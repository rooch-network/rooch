# Preserve the old `check` target if it was just framework build for quick syntax
# This is now covered by quick-check or specific move-framework target.
# The original 'clean' only removed Move artifacts and build/, now use clean-all, clean-rust, clean-move.
# The original 'framework' is move-framework.
# The original 'stdlib' is move-stdlib.
# The original 'test' only tested rooch-framework, now test-move-frameworks is more comprehensive.
# The original 'examples' target is move-examples.
