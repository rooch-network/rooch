/// A game example to show how to use the `Inscription` and `UTXO` in Rooch.
///
/// The game is about planting a plant from seed(Inscription),  then watering and harvesting.
/// The full game flow and main actions are as follows:
/// 1. Mint seed: players mint seed Inscription on Bitcoin.
/// 2. Plant: Using the seed inscription, players plant plants on Rooch.
/// 3. Water: Players water the plant on Rooch Layer 2 regularly. The seeds will grow, sprout, and bear fruit.    
/// 4. Harvest:  Players harvest the fruits. The fruit is represented by Layer2's Coin or NFT.
///
/// In this example, you will learn how Rooch is acting as a Layer 2 to interact with Bitcoin Layer 1.
/// The details are as follows:
/// 1. All Bitcoin transactions are processed and tracked on Rooch. All UTXOs are represented by the `UTXO` object on Rooch.
///     You can read all Bitcoin states. So if you have a seed Inscription on Bitcoin, you can know that.
/// 2. After planting the plant, the plant's growth status is stored in the `Inscription` 's permanently state area on Rooch .
///     Once the seed Inscription is transferred on Bitcoin, the plant produced by this seed will also be transferred.
/// 3. After watering the plant, the plant's growth status will be updated. The watering action will also be recorded in the Inscription's temporary state area.
///     Once the seed Inscription is transferred, the watering actions will be cleaned.
/// 4. Once the plants have produced, players can harvest the fruit, the fruit will be minted as a Coin or NFT on Rooch, 
///     which has no more relationship with the seed and the plant.
