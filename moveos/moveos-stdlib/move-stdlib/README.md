# Move Stdlib

The Move files in this directory are the Move standard library. They are copied from the [move-stdlib](https://github.com/move-language/move/tree/8f5303a365cf9da7554f8f18c393b3d6eb4867f2/language/move-stdlib).

Note do not directly edit the files in this directory. Instead, edit the files in the move-stdlib and sync them here.

Two modules in the Move nursery are also included here:

* [debug.move](./sources/debug.move)
* [compare.move](./sources/compare.move)
