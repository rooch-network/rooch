# Rooch Python SDK Development Status

## Overview

This document summarizes the improvements made to the Rooch Python SDK and outlines remaining tasks before the SDK can be considered production-ready.

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling

- Created a comprehensive error hierarchy
- Added detailed error classes with contextual information
- Improved error messages with more context
- Added support for error codes and additional error data

### 2. Input Validation

- Created a validator module for SDK inputs
- Added validators for addresses, function IDs, module IDs
- Added validators for type arguments and gas parameters
- Added validators for hex strings and other common inputs

### 3. Testing Improvements

- Enhanced WebSocket subscription testing
- Added tests for RPC methods
- Added tests for error handling
- Added advanced transaction building tests

### 4. Documentation

- Created comprehensive user guide
- Added detailed documentation of common workflows
- Added examples for error handling and advanced usage
- Created troubleshooting guide

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Complete API Coverage

- [ ] Implement missing RPC methods
- [ ] Add support for all Move functionalities
- [ ] Add support for module upgrading
- [ ] Add support for gas estimation

### 2. Testing Coverage

- [ ] Increase unit test coverage
- [ ] Add more integration tests
- [ ] Add BCS serialization tests for all types
- [ ] Add mock tests for offline testing

### 3. Type Safety

- [ ] Complete type annotations across the codebase
- [ ] Use TypedDict for complex dictionary structures
- [ ] Ensure mypy compliance
- [ ] Add runtime type checking for critical inputs

### 4. Performance Optimization

- [ ] Optimize HTTP connection handling
- [ ] Add support for batch RPC requests
- [ ] Improve async code paths
- [ ] Add connection pooling

### 5. Security

- [ ] Add secure key management options
- [ ] Add robust input validation
- [ ] Add rate limiting for RPC calls
- [ ] Add transaction simulation for security checks

## Testing Strategy

To ensure the SDK is production-ready, we need a comprehensive testing strategy:

### Unit Tests

- Test all utility functions
- Test address and crypto functions
- Test serialization/deserialization
- Test transaction building
- Test error handling

### Integration Tests

- Test against a local Rooch node
- Test account operations
- Test transaction execution
- Test module publishing
- Test WebSocket subscriptions

### Performance Tests

- Test large volume of transactions
- Test response times under load
- Test connection handling with many connections
- Test memory usage

### Security Tests

- Test input validation
- Test error handling under malicious inputs
- Test private key protection

## Release Checklist

Before the final release:

1. [ ] All tests passing
2. [ ] Documentation complete
3. [ ] API coverage complete
4. [ ] Type annotations complete
5. [ ] Error handling robust
6. [ ] Performance acceptable
7. [ ] Security review completed
8. [ ] Version strategy determined
9. [ ] Release notes prepared
10. [ ] Package builds and installs correctly

## Next Steps

1. Expand test coverage to at least 80%
2. Complete implementation of missing RPC methods
3. Enhance transaction building capabilities
4. Add more examples for common workflows
5. Document all API methods
6. Create CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Conclusion

The Rooch Python SDK has made significant progress but still requires additional work before it can be considered production-ready. By addressing the remaining tasks outlined in this document, we can ensure a high-quality, robust SDK that provides a great developer experience for building on the Rooch network.
