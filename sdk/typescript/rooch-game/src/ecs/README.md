# ECS - Reactive Entity Component System

`ECS` is built with reactivity in mind.
`Components` and `Queries` expose an `update$` stream, that `Systems` can react to.

# Features

- Reactive components, queries, and systems
- Powerful queries, including advanced indirect relationship queries
- Simple, declarative API
- Ultra high performance
- TypeScript support

# Example

```typescript
TODO:
```

# Acknowledgements
