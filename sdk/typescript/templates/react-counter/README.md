# Rooch dApp Starter Template

This dApp was created using `@roochnetwork/create-rooch` that sets up a simple React
Client dApp using the following tools:

- [React](https://react.dev/) as the UI framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for build tooling
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) for pre-built UI components
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting
- [@roochnetwork/rooch-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@roochnetwork/rooch-sdk) 
- [@roochnetwork/rooch-sdk-kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@roochnetwork/rooch-sdk-kit) for connecting to
  wallets and loading data
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for package management

We can ensure we have some Gss in our new wallet by requesting Gas from the [faucet doc](https://rooch.network/learn/portal) Receive Gas chapter
