# Programming with Bitcoin Blocks and Transactions

import { Callout, FileTree } from 'nextra/components'

Rooch incorporates the [bitcoin-move](https://github.com/rooch-network/rooch/tree/main/frameworks/bitcoin-move) framework, which allows developers to read Bitcoin blocks and transactions through the bitcoin-move framework and use the data carried in them for programming.

## Reading Bitcoin Blocks and Transactions in Contracts

<Callout>
TODO: This section of the document needs improvement

1. How to read transactions, including explanations of transaction fields.
2. How to read blocks, including explanations of block fields.
3. An explanation of how Bitcoin hashes are expressed and differ in Move is required.
</Callout>

## Application Scenarios

1. Use a Bitcoin hash as a random number seed to implement a random number generator. Note, this scenario requires using the hash of future blocks to prevent predictability.
2. Embed application data in Bitcoin via OP_RETURN, then read the OP_RETURN data from the transaction using a Move contract for processing.
3. Validate Bitcoin transaction scripts in Move to enable mixed programming with Move and Bitcoin Script. This feature is still in development, and progress can be tracked at [Issue #1651](https://github.com/rooch-network/rooch/issues/1651).
