# Ordinals Metaprotocol Extension

import { Callout, FileTree } from 'nextra/components'

Rooch offers a plugin mechanism that allows developers to extend the Ordinals Metaprotocol using Move.

[Bitseed](https://bitseed.pro) is an SFT protocol based on an extension of Ordinals, currently under development. We will use Bitseed as an example to demonstrate how to extend the Ordinals Metaprotocol using Move, implementing an asset validator for the Ordinals Metaprotocol, and facilitating asset transitions between Bitcoin and Rooch.

1. Specifications for extending contracts of the Metaprotocol.
2. Specifications for the asset validator.
3. Specifications for asset transitions.
