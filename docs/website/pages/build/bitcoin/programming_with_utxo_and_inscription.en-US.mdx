# Programming with Bitcoin's UTXO and Inscription

import { Callout, FileTree } from 'nextra/components'

In Rooch, Bitcoin's UTXO and Inscription are parsed into Move's [Object](https://rooch.network/learn/core-concepts/objects/object), allowing developers to manipulate Bitcoin's UTXO and Inscription via Object-related APIs.

## Atomic State Binding

Rooch implements atomic binding between Bitcoin state and Rooch L2 state through the nesting capabilities of Move's Object.

For example, the UTXO X shown above is expressed as an Object in Move, which includes a Temporary area. The states nested within this area are cleared when the UTXO is spent. This is akin to RGB's "one-time seals," leveraging the fact that a UTXO can only be spent once. For instance, an application that offers Bitcoin mining features might store user's stake information in this area, which gets lost once the UTXO is consumed. If the protocol supports UTXO mapping tracking, a Permanent Area can be provided to facilitate atomic transfers of state between L1 and L2.

As shown above, this represents a Bitcoin blockchain state in Move, such as an Ordinals Inscription (similar to RGB). Its Permanent Area can hold permanent states, such as Coins or NFTs. When the Inscription is transferred on L1, the states in the Temporary Area are cleared, but those in the Permanent Area are retained and transferred to the new owner.

## Programming with UTXO

### 1. Description of UTXO Fields

UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) is a core concept in the Bitcoin system, representing unspent transaction outputs. In the Rooch Bitcoin framework, the `UTXO` structure defines several key fields of a UTXO:

- `txid`: `address`, Represents the hash value of the transaction that generated this UTXO.
- `vout`: `u32`, Represents the index position of this UTXO within its transaction.
- `value`: `u64`, Represents the value of this UTXO, i.e., the amount of Bitcoin it contains.
- `seals`: Represents protocol inscriptions associated with this UTXO, stored using the `SimpleMultiMap` structure, mapping protocol names (`String` type) to object IDs (`ObjectID` type).

### 2. How to Accept UTXO as Method Parameters

In Rooch, UTXOs are stored as Objects in the global state. Developers can obtain a (mutable) reference to `Object<UTXO>` via `ObjectID`. The (mutable) reference to `Object<UTXO>` can be passed as a parameter to a function. Here are some examples:

- Passing an immutable reference: `fun some_function(utxo: &UTXO)`
- Passing a mutable reference: `fun some_function(utxo: &mut UTXO)`

`UTXO` objects are created and destroyed by MoveVM in real-time when parsing Bitcoin transactions, and developers cannot obtain ownership of them. They can only read the state of `UTXO` through references or store state in the temporary state area of `UTXO` through a mutable reference.

### 3. How to Store Data in the Temporary Area of UTXO

The temporary area is a field of `Object<UTXO>` and can be used to store some state. Once the UTXO is spent on Bitcoin, the MoveVM will promptly destroy the `UTXO` object on Rooch, and the state in its temporary state area will also be cleared.

The `Temporary Area` in the code is used to store temporary state data related to `UTXO`. Here are the interfaces for adding, modifying, and deleting state in the temporary area of `UTXO`:

- Use the `add_temp_state` function to add state data to the temporary area of `UTXO`. The function accepts an `UTXO` object and the state data to be stored.
- Use the `contains_temp_state` function to check if the temporary area of `UTXO` contains state data of a specific type.
- Use the `borrow_temp_state` function to borrow an immutable reference to state data of a specific type in the temporary area.
- Use the `borrow_mut_temp_state` function to borrow a mutable reference to state data of a specific type in the temporary area to modify it.
- Use the `remove_temp_state` function to remove state data of a specific type from the temporary area of `UTXO` and obtain its value.

Here are some example codes:

```rust
struct TempState has store, copy, drop {
    value: u64,
}

// Add temporary state data
add_temp_state(&mut utxo, TempState{value: 10});

// Check if temporary state data exists
if contains_temp_state::<TempState>(&utxo) {
    // ...
}

// Borrow an immutable reference to temporary state data
let state_ref = borrow_temp_state::<TempState>(&utxo);

// Borrow a mutable reference to temporary state data and modify it
{
    let state_mut = borrow_mut_temp_state::<TempState>(&mut utxo);
    state_mut.value = 20;
};

// Remove temporary state data and obtain its value
let removed_state = remove_temp_state::<TempState>(&mut utxo);
```

In the above code, `TempState` is an example state structure, which should be replaced with the specific data type in actual use.

## Programming with Inscription

### 1. Description of Inscription Fields

The Inscription structure is defined in the `ord.move` file and represents an ordered record on the Rooch network.

The Inscription structure includes the following fields:

- `txid`: Transaction ID, of type `address`.
- `index`: Index, of type `u32`.
- `input`: Transaction input index, of type `u32`.
- `offset`: Offset, of type `u64`.
- `body`: Content body, of type `vector<u8>`.
- `content_encoding`: Content encoding, of type `Option<String>`.
- `content_type`: Content type, of type `Option<String>`.
- `metadata`: Metadata, of type `vector<u8>`.
- `metaprotocol`: Meta-protocol, of type `Option<String>`.
- `parent`: Parent object ID, of type `Option<ObjectID>`.
- `pointer`: Pointer, of type `Option<u64>`.

### 2. How to Accept Inscription as Method Parameters

In Rooch, `Inscription` is stored as an `Object<Inscription>` in the global state. Developers can accept the structure as a parameter by using a reference (`&`) or a mutable reference (`&mut`) to read data contained in the Inscription or to save temporary or permanent state in the Inscription object.

For example, you can define a method to accept a mutable reference to an `Inscription` as follows:

```move
public entry fun plant(seed: &mut Object<Inscription>) {
    // ...
}
```

### 3. How to Store Data in the Temporary and Permanent Areas of Inscription

Similar to the temporary area of `UTXO`, the `Object<Inscription>` object also has a temporary area that is cleared once the `Object<Inscription>` is transferred. Additionally, `Object<Inscription>` has a permanent area where state can be stored permanently and will be transferred along with the `Object<Inscription>`.

In the `plants.move` example, it demonstrates how to store data in the permanent and temporary areas of Inscription:

- **Permanent Area**: Use the `ord::add_permanent_state` function to store data. This data will remain in the Inscription until explicitly removed. For example, planting information and plant status are stored in the permanent area:

```move
ord::add_permanent_state(seed, plant);
```

- **Temporary Area**: Use the `ord::add_temp_state` function to store data. This data is temporary and can be cleaned up after certain operations. For example, planting actions are stored in the temporary area:

```move
ord::add_temp_state(seed, actions);
```

In addition, there are corresponding functions for reading and removing data from these areas:

- `ord::borrow_mut_permanent_state<T>` is used to obtain a mutable reference to data of a specific type stored in the permanent area.
- `ord::borrow_mut_temp_state<T>` is used to obtain a mutable reference to data of a specific type stored in the temporary area.
- `ord::remove_permanent_state<T>` is used to remove data of a specific type from the permanent area.

Interfaces for adding, modifying, and deleting state in the temporary area:

- Use the `add_temp_state` function to add state data to the temporary area of `Inscription`. The function accepts an `Inscription` object and the state data to be stored.
- Use the `contains_temp_state` function to check if the temporary area of `Inscription` contains state data of a specific type.
- Use the `borrow_temp_state` function to borrow an immutable reference to state data of a specific type in the temporary area.
- Use the `borrow_mut_temp_state` function to borrow a mutable reference to state data of a specific type in the temporary area to modify it.
- Use the `remove_temp_state` function to remove state data of a specific type from the temporary area of `Inscription` and obtain its value.

Interfaces for adding, modifying, and deleting state in the permanent area:

- Use the `add_permanent_state` function to add state data to the permanent area of `Inscription`. The function accepts an `Inscription` object and the state data to be stored.
- Use the `contains_permanent_state` function to check if the permanent area of `Inscription` contains state data of a specific type.
- Use the `borrow_permanent_state` function to borrow an immutable reference to state data of a specific type in the permanent area.
- Use the `borrow_mut_permanent_state` function to borrow a mutable reference to state data of a specific type in the permanent area to modify it.
- Use the `remove_permanent_state` function to remove state data of a specific type from the permanent area of `Inscription` and obtain its value.
