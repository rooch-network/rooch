# Rooch CLI

Learn how to set up, configure, and use the Rooch command line interface (CLI). You can experiment with Rooch features through the Rooch CLI.

## Installation

When you install Rooch, the Rooch CLI is installed. See the [installation](../getting-started/installation) topic for prerequisites and installation instructions.

Rooch CLI supports the following commands:

```bash
[joe@mx rooch]$ rooch --help

Usage: rooch <COMMAND>

Commands:
  account      Tool for interacting with accounts
  init         Tool for init with rooch
  move         CLI frontend for the Move compiler and VM
  server       Start Rooch network
  state        Get states by accessPath
  object       Get object by object id
  resource     Get account resource by tag
  transaction  Tool for interacting with transaction

  rpc
  help         Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

```

Use `rooch -h` to see a list of supported commands.

Use `rooch help <COMMAND>` to see more information about a specified command.

## Initialize Rooch configuration

By default, Rooch's configuration files are saved in your `home` directory.

Use `rooch init` to initialize the Rooch account, and the location of the configuration file is specified with `--config-dir`.

The response is similar to the following:

```bash
[joe@mx rooch]$ rooch init

Rooch server config file generated at /home/joe/.rooch/rooch_config/server.yaml
Creating client config file ["/home/joe/.rooch/rooch_config/rooch.yaml"] with rooch native validator.
Enter a password to encrypt the keys. Press enter to leave it an empty password:

> Tip: When prompted to set the password for the encryption key, if you press `Enter` directly, it means no password is set!
