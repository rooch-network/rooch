## About the sample project naming explanation

Rooch provides the command `rooch move new` to automatically create and initialize projects. When we want to write a new contract project, we can use this command to simplify our initialization work.

We can use any legal character as the project name, including `-`, but when we use a project name with `-`, the `rooch move new` command will automatically use the project name as the address of this project.

For example:

```shell
move rooch new hello-world
```

However, `-` is not a legal character for naming addresses (variables), so after we create the project using `rooch move new`, be sure to check the project address alias in the `Move.toml` file for illegal characters.

Use `rooch move new` to create a project (name) with `-`. We recommend manually modifying the `Move.toml` file and replacing `-` with `_`.

Another way is to directly use `_` as the hyphen for the project name word when creating the project.

For example:

```shell
move rooch new hello_world
```

In Rooch's `examples`, the names of the projects we create use `_` connection. As for the actual development, which style to use, please decide according to your preferences.

When we contribute a example to `examples`, after using `rooch move new` to initialize the project, in addition to replacing the project address of the `Move.toml` file with `_` wildcards, we also need to add a `[dev-addresses]` table and fill in a field for unit testing. address.

The `[dev-addresses]` table not added to `examples/quick_start_counter/Move.toml`:

```shell
BUILDING quick_start_counter
Success
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.53s
     Running `target/debug/rooch move test -p examples/quick_start_counter`
thread 'main' panicked at 'resolve package dep failed: Unresolved addresses found: [
Named address 'quick_start_counter' in package 'quick_start_counter'
]
To fix this, add an entry for each unresolved address to the [addresses] section of examples/quick_start_counter/Move.toml: e.g.,
[addresses]
Std = "0x1"
Alternatively, you can also define [dev-addresses] and call with the -d flag', crates/rooch/src/commands/move_cli/commands/unit_test.rs:64:14
