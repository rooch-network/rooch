# Rooch TypeScript SDK quick start

The Rooch TypeScript SDK is a modular library of tools for interacting with the Rooch Layer2. Use it to send queries to RPC nodes, build and sign transactions, and interact with a Rooch or local network.

This article mainly guides you to quickly get started with Roock's TypeScript development tools (TS SDK).

## Create new project

> Note: This tutorial is demonstrated in a Linux environment!

First create a directory, and then use package management tools such as JS/TS to initialize the project - `sdk-quick-start`:

```bash
mkdir sdk-quick-start
cd sdk-quick-start
```

```bash
[joe@mx sdk-quick-start]$ npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.

  },

}


Is this OK? (yes) yes
```

## Add dependencies

Here you only need to add the `rooch-sdk` dependency:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @roochnetwork/rooch-sdk
```

Check the `package.json` file, the `dependencies` list we need to use has been added:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@roochnetwork/rooch-sdk": "^0.1.0"
}
```

## Update configuration

Add the following line to `package.json` to enable module features:

```json
"type": "module",
```

## Call RPC methods in code

```ts
import pkg from '@roochnetwork/rooch-sdk';
const { DevNetwork, RoochClient } = pkg;

// create a provider connected to devnet
const provider = new RoochClient(DevNetwork);

console.log(provider);
```

Here we mainly use `RoochClient` to create a client instance and obtain some common Rooch RPC operation methods.

The object information of `RoochClient` is displayed here.

```json
[joe@mx sdk-quick-start]$ node index.js

RoochClient {
  options: { versionCacheTimeoutInSeconds: 600 },
  network: Network {
    id: 20230103,
    name: 'dev',
    options: { url: 'https://dev-seed.rooch.network:443' }
  },
  client: JsonRpcClient {
    requestManager: RequestManager {
      batch: [],
      batchStarted: false,
      lastId: -1,
      transports: [Array],
      requests: {},
      connectPromise: [Promise],
      requestChannel: [EventEmitter],
      nextID: [Function (anonymous)]
    }
  }
}
```

We use an RPC method `ChainInfo()` provided by the client to view the current information of the chain:

```ts
const rooch_chain = provider.ChainInfo();

// console.log(provider);
console.log(rooch_chain);
```

Return:

```json
{
  chainId: '0x134afd7',
  chainName: 'dev',
  iconUrls: [
    'https://github.com/rooch-network/rooch/blob/main/docs/website/public/logo/rooch_black_text.png'
  ],
  nativeCurrency: { name: 'ROH', symbol: 'ROH', decimals: 18 },
  rpcUrls: [ 'https://dev-seed.rooch.network:443' ]
}
```

Then we can use the returned JSON information to perform corresponding operations.

Modify the code as follows:

```ts
import pkg from '@roochnetwork/rooch-sdk';
const { DevNetwork, RoochClient } = pkg;

// create a provider connected to devnet
const provider = new RoochClient(DevNetwork);

const rooch_chain = provider.ChainInfo();

// console.log(provider);
// console.log(rooch_chain);

console.log(
  `Welcome to Rooch Typescript SDK Quick Start!\n
=> The network you are currently linked to is ${rooch_chain.chainName}.
=> The RPC URL is ${rooch_chain.rpcUrls}
=> Rooch's Token is "${rooch_chain.nativeCurrency.symbol}."`
);
```

Running result:

```bash
[joe@mx sdk-quick-start]$ node index.js

Welcome to Rooch Typescript SDK Quick Start!

=> The network you are currently linked to is dev.
=> The RPC URL is https://dev-seed.rooch.network:443
=> Rooch's Token is "ROH."
```

## Summary

At this point, you already know how to use the SDK!

Using the SDK we can easily use RPC methods in code to handle corresponding operations without having to manually enter RPC methods on the command line.

Next, we will take you to start the Rooch TypeScript SDK development journey!
