# Extending Bitcoin

Rooch, as the application layer of Bitcoin, provides a programmable environment for Bitcoin through off-chain smart contracts. Developers can use Rooch to extend the Bitcoin protocol and develop applications within its ecosystem.

Rooch offers several ways to extend the Bitcoin protocol or to interact with Bitcoin:

- **[Programming with Bitcoin blocks and transactions](./bitcoin/programming_with_block_and_tx)**: Developers can access Bitcoin blocks and transactions within contracts and use the data contained in them for programming.
- **[Bitcoin Asset Protocol Extension](./bitcoin/ordinals_metaprotocol_extension)**: Developers can deploy contracts to Rooch to extend the Bitcoin asset protocol, such as by deploying a new asset protocol based on Ordinals.
- **[Programming with Bitcoin UTXO and Inscription](./bitcoin/programming_with_utxo_and_inscription)**: Rooch has automatically parsed Bitcoin UTXO and Inscription through the bitcoin-move system contract, allowing developers to directly use these assets for programming.

There are many more scenarios to explore, and we welcome everyone to join in the development of Bitcoin ecosystem applications.
