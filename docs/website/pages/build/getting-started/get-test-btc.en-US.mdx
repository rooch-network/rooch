# Get tBTC

Rooch now provides some applications that interact with Bitcoin, such as staking, games, etc. We need to use `tBTC` as the interactive asset.

Therefore, you need to obtain some `BTC` on the Bitcoin test network through some ways.

- You can get it through certain Bitcoin faucets.
- You can get it through Rooch's Discord, and we'll explain how to get it in detail below.

## Get it via Rooch Discord

1. Enter the `testnet-faucet` channel on Rooch Discord:

Roochâ€™s Discord address: https://discord.gg/rooch

2. Set Bitcoin testnet address:

Enter `!setaddress <BTC_ADDRESS>` in the input box to set the address to obtain `tBTC`.

Demo:

```
!setaddress tb1p8e5wrjksara963wm27lppr9z8wcfsj2htzdjgutp3rsx2lt0gd4smrdnn5
```

Receiving the following prompt indicates that it has been added successfully:

```

```

3. Ask the Discord bot for `tBTC`:

Enter `!claim` in the input box to get `0.01 BTC`.
