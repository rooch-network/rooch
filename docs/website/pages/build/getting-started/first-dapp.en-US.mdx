# The First Rooch dApp

This tutorial primarily introduces how to use the front-end template provided by Rooch to implement a simple counter dApp.

[Teplate Repo](https://github.com/rooch-network/my-first-rooch-dapp)

## Clone the source code of the template.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rooch-network/my-first-rooch-dapp.git
```

## Initialize the project.

Install the dependencies required for the dApp:

```bash
cd my-first-rooch-dapp
bun install
## if you are using yarn
yarn install
```

Run dAppï¼š
```bash
bun dev
```

Once everything is successfully completed, access the local preview link in the browser and you will see the following interface:

Congratulations! After completing the above steps, it indicates that your dApp is running successfully. To complete the full on-chain interaction, we still need to deploy the contract.

## Confirm the Current Network in Rooch CLI

We use the Testnet to deploy the Counter dApp, and use `rooch env switch` to switch the network:

```bash
rooch env switch --alias test

The active environment was successfully switched to `test`
```

## Publish the contract.

In the `counter_contract` directory, you can see the contract source code of the Counter dApp.

Navigate to the `counter_contract` directory and use the following command to deploy the contract.

Please note, before deployment, ensure that you have sufficient Gas Fee in your account. We can use the following command to check:

```bash
rooch account balance

## output

      Coin Type        |      Symbol      | Decimals |  Balance              
--------------------------------------------------------------------
0x3::gas_coin::RGas |       RGAS        |     8    | 1939625968
```

[Get Rooch Gas Coin](./get-gas-coin.en-US)

After confirming that there is enough Gas Fee, you can publish the contract using the following command.

```bash
## in counter_contract directory
rooch move publish --named-addresses quick_start_counter=default
```

After the deployment is completed, we can see the output in the command line:

```bash
BUILDING quick_start_counter
Publish modules to address: rooch1e7qm7jqangukl37qs49ckv7j4w47zyu5cr2gd9tmzal89q9sudqqzhy92t
(0xcf81bf481d9a396fc7c0854b8b33d2ababe11394c0d486957b177e7280b0e340)
...
```

As the output of the command line above, the Counter has been published to the address `0xcf81bf481d9a396fc7c0854b8b33d2ababe11394c0d486957b177e7280b0e340`.


## Modify the front-end configuration.

Find the `src/App.tsx` file in the front-end project and modify the constant `counterAddress`:

```tsx
// Publish address of the counter contract
const counterAddress = "YOUR_COUNTER_ADDRESS";
```

Replace with the Counter contract address published in the previous step:

```bash
const counterAddress = "0xcf81bf481d9a396fc7c0854b8b33d2ababe11394c0d486957b177e7280b0e340"
```

> Note: The contract address here will be related to the publisher's address, please confirm.

## Contract Interaction

Connect the wallet, and we can click the `Create` button in the Session Key area to create a session key:

[About Session Key](../../../archives/session-key)

After the creation is complete, you can see the relevant information of the Session Key:

After replacing the contract address, you can also see the count of `Counter Value` in the dApp Integration area.

![](/docs/first-dapp/dapp-counter-value.png)

After completing the above steps, you can click the `Increase Counter Value` button in the dApp Integration area to call the contract and increase the counter value.

## Summary

After completing the above steps, you have mastered the skills of **creating a dApp**, **deploying contracts**, and performing **basic interactions between the front-end and the contract**.
