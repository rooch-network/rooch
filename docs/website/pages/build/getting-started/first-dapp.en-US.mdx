# The first DApp

This tutorial mainly introduces how to use the DApp front-end template tool provided by Rooch to create a counter program.

## Create project

```bash
pnpm create @roochnetwork/create-rooch
```

## Initialize project

Dependencies required to install DApp:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run DAppï¼š

```bash
pnpm dev
```

When everything goes well, you will see the following in the browser:

This step shows that the front end is working normally. Next, the contract needs to be deployed so that the DApp can interact with the contract.

## Switch network

Currently, the Counter DApp application is created in the local network demonstration and uses `rooch env switch` to switch the network:

```bash
rooch env switch --alias local

The active environment was successfully switched to `local`
```

## Start the Rooch local node

```bash
rooch server start
```

## Deploy contract

We use the `examples/counter` contract for deployment.

```bash
rooch move publish --named-addresses rooch_examples=default
```

## Modify front-end configuration

Find the `src/App.tsx` file in the front-end project and modify the `devCounterAddress` constant:

```tsx
// Your publish counter contract address
const devCounterAddress = ""
const devCounterModule = `${devCounterAddress}::counter`
```

Add the address where the Counter contract is deployed:

```bash
const devCounterAddress = "0x634e4b692ac7873bb937af3f0ac9bc63c4c6ead3f857c5bbc92e3ff41f756651"
```

> Note: Modify according to the actual deployment address!

## Call contract

After connecting to the wallet, you will be prompted to create a session key:

After everything is ready, you can call the Counter contract in the DApp. Click the `Increment` button to increase the value of the counter:

## Summarize

At this point, you have mastered how to create a DApp, complete the initialization work on the front end and contract side, and perform basic interactions.
