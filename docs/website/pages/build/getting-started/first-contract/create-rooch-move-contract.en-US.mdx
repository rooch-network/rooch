# Create Rooch Move contract

This section introduces how to use Rooch CLI to create a Move contract.

## Create project

```shell
rooch move new hello_rooch
```

After executing this Rooch CLI command, a Rooch contract project will be created and automatically initialized. The root directory of the project contains a `sources` directory for storing the Move contract code, and a manifest file named `Move.toml` for declaring the current project. The name, version, address alias (named address) and project dependencies.

Contents of the `Move.toml` file of the `hello-rooch` project:

```toml
[package]
name = "hello_rooch"
version = "0.0.1"

[dependencies]
MoveStdlib = { git = "https://github.com/rooch-network/rooch.git", subdir = "moveos/moveos-stdlib/move-stdlib", rev = "main" }
MoveosStdlib = { git = "https://github.com/rooch-network/rooch.git", subdir = "moveos/moveos-stdlib/moveos-stdlib", rev = "main" }
RoochFramework = { git = "https://github.com/rooch-network/rooch.git", subdir = "crates/rooch-framework", rev = "main" }

[addresses]
hello_rooch = "0xf5ecfc49f55e283119104978b60995b0ec84a5bd760a0305b24b9a4175deff7b"
std = "0x1"
moveos_std = "0x2"
rooch_framework = "0x3"
```

## Write a contract

We simply write a Move contract to demonstrate storing a "Hello Rooch!" string into Rooch's account storage.

```move
module hello_rooch::hello_rooch {
    use std::string;
    use moveos_std::context::{Self, Context};

    struct HelloMessage has key {
        text: string::String
    }

    entry fun say_hello(ctx: &mut Context, owner: &signer) {
        let hello = HelloMessage { text: string::utf8(b"Hello Rooch!") };
        context::move_resource_to(ctx, owner, hello);
    }
}
```

Define a `HelloMessage` type, which is a structure containing a `text` field.

Then define an entry function `say_hello`, build a resource instance that stores `Hello Rooch!`, and move it to the account storage.
