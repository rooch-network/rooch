# First account

This tutorial mainly introduces how to obtain a Rooch account.

## Get a Rooch account using the CLI

There are two ways to obtain Rooch using the command line: automatically create a default account during default initialization, and manually call the account creation command to generate a new account.

1. Default account

```bash
[joe@mx ~]$ rooch init
Rooch server config file generated at /home/joe/.rooch/rooch_config/server.yaml
Creating client config file ["/home/joe/.rooch/rooch_config/rooch.yaml"] with rooch native validator.
Enter a password to encrypt the keys. Press enter to leave it an empty password:
Generated new keypair for address [0xd1d967e18284e5289adccf4df9b9f2c9f60c4ea8872d3027df7a8c3972460a75]
Secret Recovery Phrase : [trust please grit chief ankle brick bean level infant embark chronic zebra]
Rooch client config file generated at /home/joe/.rooch/rooch_config/rooch.yaml
null
```

This generates an account `0xd1d967e18284e5289adccf4df9b9f2c9f60c4ea8872d3027df7a8c3972460a75`, along with its recovery phrase (mnemonic).

This is the account generated when `rooch init` is used to initialize the Rooch configuration. The account is stored in `$HOME/.rooch/rooch_config/rooch.keystore`.

## Create manually

```bash
[joe@mx ~]$ rooch account create
Generated new keypair for address with key pair type [0xaecf8918b5ffc84a4bf4a8710220e70d1ec47beda53534f0c57689f82548048a]
Secret Recovery Phrase : [trust please grit chief ankle brick bean level infant embark chronic zebra]
"0xaecf8918b5ffc84a4bf4a8710220e70d1ec47beda53534f0c57689f82548048a"
```

A new account is manually created here, `0xaecf8918b5ffc84a4bf4a8710220e70d1ec47beda53534f0c57689f82548048a`.

This account address is derived from the same set of mnemonic words, so it can also be recovered using the same mnemonic word.

## Create an account with Rooch Portal

When connecting to the Rooch Portal using UniSat, a Rooch account is automatically created and linked to the Bitcoin account.
