# Run a local testnet 

This section will introduce how to use Rooch CLI to start local development environment.

In the current version, we provide the `rooch server start` and `rooch server clean` commands to start the Rooch local service and clean the server storage respectively.

Because Rooch is in the process of rapid development and iteration, you may encounter compatibility issues when deploying contracts. At this time, you can use the `clean` command to clean up old data.

## Start service

When we finish writing the Rooch Move contract project, we need to start the Rooch local testnet to deploy and test the contract.

```shell
rooch server start

StoreConfig init store dir "/Users/username/.rooch/local/roochdb/rooch_store" "/Users/username/.rooch/local/roochdb/moveos_store"

```

## Local testnet information

1. Name: local
2. ChainID: 4
3. RPC: http://localhost:50051

## Solve data compatibility issues

If you encounter service data conflicts, first execute the clear command and then continue to start the service:

```shell
$ rooch server clean

StoreConfig init store dir "/Users/username/.rooch/local/roochdb/rooch_store" "/Users/username/.rooch/local/roochdb/moveos_store"
Rooch server storage successfully cleaned
```
