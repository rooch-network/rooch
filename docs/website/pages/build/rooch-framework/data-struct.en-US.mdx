# Data Struct

import { Callout, FileTree } from 'nextra/components'

`#[data_struct]` is a struct annotation used to mark a struct as a pure data struct, allowing it to be directly deserialized within a contract. This feature is designed to facilitate developers in retrieving data from external data sources.

## Example

```move
module my_project::my_module {
    #[data_struct]
    struct MyData has copy, drop {
        value: u64,
        name: vector<u8>,
    }
}
```

With this annotation, developers can directly deserialize the `MyData` struct within a contract:

```move
let data: MyData = moveos_std::bcs::from_bytes(bytes);
```

The `moveos_std::bcs::from_bytes` function also uses the `#[data_struct(T)]` annotation to ensure that `T` must be a `#[data_struct]` type.

```move
module moveos_std::bcs {
    #[data_struct(T)]
    /// Function to deserialize a type T.
    /// The `data_struct` annotation ensures that `T` must be a `#[data_struct]` type.
    public fun from_bytes<T>(bytes: vector<u8>): T;
}
```

## How It Works

The `#[data_struct]` annotation is implemented based on the Move verifier, which checks the struct definition at compile time to ensure it meets the `data_struct` requirements. Additionally, the contract is re-verified during deployment.
