# Quick start

This section will quickly introduce the development of Rooch through a counter example.

## What is counter

The counter is a small counting program. It contains an initial value. We can increment its value through an increment instruction to achieve the purpose of counting.

We can use any programming language to implement this small program. This tutorial will use the Move language to write it and let it run successfully on Rooch.

## Create counter project

Before we create the counter contract program, we can use the CLI command provided by Rooch to initialize an empty project:

```shell
rooch move new quick_start_counter
```

For detailed methods, please refer to [Creating a Rooch Move Contract](./create-rooch-move-contract).

Next, create a `counter.move` file in the `sources` directory to write our contract code.

## Contract writing

```move
module quick_start_counter::quick_start_counter {
    use moveos_std::account_storage;
    use moveos_std::context::Context;

    struct Counter has key {
        count_value: u64
    }

    fun init(ctx: &mut Context, account: &signer) {
        context::move_resource_to(ctx, account, Counter { count_value: 0 });
    }

    entry fun increase(ctx: &mut Context) {
        let counter = context::borrow_mut_resource<Counter>(ctx, @quick_start_counter);
        counter.count_value = counter.count_value + 1;
    }
}
```

With a simple 17 lines of code, a simple counter function is implemented on Rooch Move.

What follows is a detailed description of what each line of code does.

### Module declaration

In the Move language, contracts are usually written in modules. Simple contracts can be completed through one module, while complex contracts may be composed of multiple modules. Our counter contract is very simple, so there is only one `quick_start_counter` module.

Modules usually contain data types and functions required to implement the current module functions.

```move
module quick_start_counter::quick_start_counter {
```

In line 1, we declare a `quick_start_counter` module using the `module` keyword.

In the Move-based blockchain system, modules are uniquely identified by address, that is, an address can only have one module of the same type, and modules of the same type cannot be released multiple times. The same contract can be issued by multiple addresses. In order to identify who issued the contract module in the huge blockchain system, it needs to be uniquely identified by the `address`.
In the Move-based blockchain system, modules are uniquely identified by address, that is, an address can only have one module with the same name, and modules with the same name cannot be published multiple times. The same contract can be published by multiple addresses. In order to identify who published the contract module in the blockchain system, it needs to be uniquely identified by the `address`.

Therefore, the syntax for declaring a Move module is `module address::module_name`.

### Import module

```move
use moveos_std::account_storage;
use moveos_std::context::Context;
```

In lines 2~3, it is a statement that imports modules. To implement a counter contract on Rooch, we need to use some functional libraries of the Rooch. This contract uses functional modules such as the `account_storage` and `context` provided by the MoveOS Standard Library.

### Define data structure

```move
struct Counter has key {
    count_value: u64
}
```

We define a `Counter` type structure to record the count value. The structure only contains a `u64` type field `count_value`.

We want to record the value of the `Counter` type into Rooch's global storage, so we need to provide a `key` ability for this type so that Move can find the data through the **key**.

### Initialization function

```move
fun init(ctx: &mut Context, account: &signer) {
    context::move_resource_to(ctx, account, Counter { value: 0 })
}
```

Move provides a specific initialization function `init` to automatically initialize the contract to ensure that some necessary operations have been performed after the contract is released.

For example, we hope that once the counter contract is released, the contract will automatically initialize the counter for us so that its count value is `0`.

Line 9 is the function signature of the `init` function, which accepts two parameters `ctx` and `account`.

### Increasing function

Next, we need to define an incrementing function that will increment the counter value by `1` every time it is executed.

```move
entry fun increase(ctx: &mut Context) {
    let counter = context::borrow_mut_resource<Counter>(ctx, @quick_start_counter);
    counter.count_value = counter.count_value + 1;
}
```

Line 13 is the signature of the `increase` function, which accepts a context parameter.

In line 14, the `borrow_mut_resource` instruction of the account storage provided by Rooch is called to obtain a mutable reference of type `Counter`, and the return value of the function is bound to the `counter` variable. By borrowing a mutable reference from `Counter`, we can modify its value.

The `borrow_mut_resource` function accepts a context parameter and an address parameter to borrow the `Counter` resource. For simplicity, we directly use the address of the published counter module as the borrower.

In line 15, we obtain the field value of the `Counter` structure through member operations and perform an increment operation.

At this point, we have implemented the incrementing logic of the counter.

### Entry function

The entry function is a function modified by the `entry` keyword.

For security reasons, the Move virtual machine prohibits external (command line, etc.) direct calls to functions that operate module data. Instead, a method called an `entry function` is provided to indirectly call logical functions. The entry function is the contract exposed to the outside what an interface.

> Note: In order to simplify the counter contract demonstrated in this example as much as possible, we merged the logical operation and entry function into one `increase` function. In actual development, it is recommended to encapsulate the logic and entry function separately into different functions.

As you can see, the `increase` function on line 13 is modified with the `entry` keyword, so it becomes an entry function. With the entry function, we can perform the counter increment operation in the command line or other clients.

> Special note that the context parameters of the `increase` function are parameters automatically passed by Move VM. They need to be passed explicitly when writing the contract. However, for external calls, they do not need to be passed manually, so when calling the `increase` function on the command line, they do not need to pass any arguments.

## Demo counter program in Rooch's CLI

1. First check whether the currently activated Rooch network is the `dev` network:

```shell
$ rooch env list

       Env Alias         |                     RPC URL                      |                  Websocket URL                   |  Active Env
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         local           |               http://0.0.0.0:50051               |                       Null                       |
          dev            |       https://dev-seed.rooch.network:443/        |                       Null                       |     True
```

Note that if the `dev` environment of `Active Env` is not `True`, use the `rooch env switch --alias dev` command to switch to the development network.

2. Open another terminal, switch to the root directory of the `counter` project, and compile the contract:

```shell
$ rooch move build

{
  "sequence_info": {
    "tx_order": "17128",
    "tx_order_signature": {
      "auth_validator_id": "0",
      "payload": "0x00b5d56a8178299d628e0d341fff4b97904f7ff80f9e3e8aca10f0d1d9ac65e5736757caec9be17aa54b1da860b183a6d1574f1db9ba632910fb308c4d6283d30eca2ecf17ab26b7c32ddba10913e6f74d43b5258905bef0f88b6d744d73bc9ce9"
    },
    "tx_accumulator_root": "0xb408f55b7e003f54fa37a87ccaa25937bedb7d04d3d8a06f745de4e30b25a3cf"
  },
  "execution_info": {
    "tx_hash": "0xa45998b0a7d979597d0ed4021c2ffbe778d2e0889d3151ad29493e3d91f177a6",
    "state_root": "0x0a5f095123b459749938b4fc436c06c429066f6a48a8f014bba6360471b6d03b",
    "event_root": "0x8be169d5a1b2bdace1ff085fae4753e37f69095ec543a83ef34cae23e9ebb747",
    "gas_used": 1644906,
    "status": {
      "type": "executed"
    }
  },
......
```

When you see `executed` in the `execution_info.status` of the output result, it means that the counter contract has been successfully released and the counter has been initialized.

4. We use the resource search command provided by Rooch to obtain information about `Counter` resources.

The syntax is `rooch resource --address address_of_published_resource --resource resource_type`:

```shell
$ rooch resource --address 0xc4a286bef174e126ef24363a0799c069504d0f132f713bf4762ad127c799df81 --resource 0xc4a286bef174e126ef24363a0799c069504d0f132f713bf4762ad127c799df81::quick_start_counter::Counter

{
  "value": "0x0000000000000000",
  "value_type": "0xc4a286bef174e126ef24363a0799c069504d0f132f713bf4762ad127c799df81::quick_start_counter::Counter",
  "decoded_value": {
    "abilities": 8,
    "type": "0xc4a286bef174e126ef24363a0799c069504d0f132f713bf4762ad127c799df81::quick_start_counter::Counter",
    "value": {
      "count_value": "0"
    }
  }
}
```

Pay attention to the `value` attribute. You can see that in the output information of the `Counter` resource, the field `count_value` of Counter is indeed `0`.

5. Then we call the counter’s increment function:

The syntax is `rooch move run --function address_published_by_the_module::module_name::entry_function_name --sender-account address_to_send_the_current_transaction`.

> Note: In the blockchain system, performing certain operations is usually performed by sending a transaction to the blockchain system to perform the corresponding operation.

```shell
$ rooch move run --function 0xc4a286bef174e126ef24363a0799c069504d0f132f713bf4762ad127c799df81::quick_start_counter::increase --sender-account 0xc4a286bef174e126ef24363a0799c069504d0f132f713bf4762ad127c799df81

{
  "sequence_info": {
    "tx_order": "17160",
    "tx_order_signature": {
      "auth_validator_id": "0",
      "payload": "0x00f3809e65ee7aef9d9f4f7f79820ad6a25d44aed583c74300f30a0550f8256e371546e4515125636646acb3e625bb5d02db933656218832103300861b4a2b9d07ca2ecf17ab26b7c32ddba10913e6f74d43b5258905bef0f88b6d744d73bc9ce9"
    },
    "tx_accumulator_root": "0x89ace9f8d15707a008f7237566761e28743a4c73d9f5b19622c65e4a072850bc"
  },
  "execution_info": {
    "tx_hash": "0x19139e0f8779c43e7feb989553d66e41eab2840705417898dee376b3ea2ea3d0",
    "state_root": "0xb876495e3c144700fb315cf2697a990d25578b4b832f9b34bb74e4f233d4faf2",
    "event_root": "0x414343554d554c41544f525f504c414345484f4c4445525f4841534800000000",
    "gas_used": 12769,
    "status": {
      "type": "executed"
    }
  },
......
```

If you see `executed` in the `status`, it proves that the `increase` function call was successful.

6. Check again to see if the counter value is what we expected:

```shell
$ rooch resource --address 0xc4a286bef174e126ef24363a0799c069504d0f132f713bf4762ad127c799df81 --resource 0xc4a286bef174e126ef24363a0799c069504d0f132f713bf4762ad127c799df81::quick_start_counter::Counter

{
  "value": "0x0100000000000000",
  "value_type": "0xc4a286bef174e126ef24363a0799c069504d0f132f713bf4762ad127c799df81::quick_start_counter::Counter",
  "decoded_value": {
    "abilities": 8,
    "type": "0xc4a286bef174e126ef24363a0799c069504d0f132f713bf4762ad127c799df81::quick_start_counter::Counter",
    "value": {
      "count_value": "1"
    }
  }
}
```

As you can see, the value of the `Counter`'s `value` field has indeed been updated to `1`.

At this point, you already know how to write contracts in Rooch and how to call contracts from the command line.

Next, let's increase the difficulty a little bit and we will demonstrate how to run and use the counter contract program in the front end.

## Quick experience

The source code of this example is stored in the `rooch/examples/quick_start_counter` directory. To make testing easier, we change the address in the `Move.toml` file to the wildcard character `_`.

If you run it directly using the example we provided, the executed Shell command will be a little different:

```shell
$ rooch move build --named-addresses quick_start_counter=default

$ rooch move publish --named-addresses quick_start_counter=default

# 注意 `0xc4a286bef174e126ef24363a0799c069504d0f132f713bf4762ad127c799df81` 是我演示的地址，当你实际运行时，需要更改为你自己的钱包地址
$ rooch resource --address 0xc4a286bef174e126ef24363a0799c069504d0f132f713bf4762ad127c799df81 --resource 0xc4a286bef174e126ef24363a0799c069504d0f132f713bf4762ad127c799df81::quick_start_counter::Counter

$ rooch move run --function 0xc4a286bef174e126ef24363a0799c069504d0f132f713bf4762ad127c799df81::quick_start_counter::increase --sender-account default

$ rooch resource --address 0xc4a286bef174e126ef24363a0799c069504d0f132f713bf4762ad127c799df81 --resource 0xc4a286bef174e126ef24363a0799c069504d0f132f713bf4762ad127c799df81::quick_start_counter::Counter
```

> Note: The `default` in the command represents the default address in the Rooch configuration. If you want to use another address, you can also directly pass the address starting with `0x`.
