# Start the Rooch development environment

## Introduction

As a Layer2, Rooch aims to provide multi-chain friendly development services. Rooch can be regarded as an infrastructure platform that specifically provides container services for blockchain.

This section will introduce how to use Rooch CLI to start local development environment.

In the current version, we provide the `rooch server start` and `rooch server clean` commands to start the Rooch local service and clean the server storage respectively.

Because Rooch is in the process of rapid development and iteration, you may encounter compatibility issues when deploying contracts. At this time, you can use the `clean` command to clean up old data.

## Start service

When we finish writing the Rooch Move contract project, we need to start the Rooch container service to simulate the behavior of the chain:

```shell
$ rooch server start

StoreConfig init store dir "/tmp/.tmpHkNH5Q/dev/roochdb/rooch_store" "/tmp/.tmpHkNH5Q/dev/roochdb/moveos_store"
2023-09-14T08:21:33.234354Z  INFO moveos_common::utils: set max open fds 45056
2023-09-14T08:21:34.013627Z  INFO rooch_rpc_server: acl=Const("*")
2023-09-14T08:21:34.013899Z  INFO rooch_rpc_server: JSON-RPC HTTP Server start listening 0.0.0.0:50051
2023-09-14T08:21:34.013910Z  INFO rooch_rpc_server: Available JSON-RPC methods : ["eth_blockNumber", "eth_sendTransaction", "eth_sendRawTransaction", "net_version", "rooch_listAnnotatedStates", "rooch_sendRawTransaction", "rooch_getAnnotatedStates", "rooch_executeRawTransaction", "eth_estimateGas", "rooch_executeViewFunction", "rooch_getBalances", "rooch_getEvents", "rooch_getStates", "eth_getBalance", "eth_gasPrice", "eth_getTransactionByHash", "eth_getTransactionCount", "rooch_getTransactionByIndex", "rooch_getEventsByEventHandle", "eth_getTransactionReceipt", "rooch_getTransactionByHash", "eth_getBlockByNumber", "eth_feeHistory", "eth_getBlockByHash", "rooch_listStates", "rooch_getTransactionInfosByTxOrder", "eth_chainId", "rooch_getTransactionInfosByTxHash", "wallet_sign", "wallet_accounts"]
```

## Solve data compatibility issues

If you encounter service data conflicts, first execute the clear command and then continue to start the service:

```shell
$ rooch server clean

StoreConfig init store dir "/tmp/.tmpJmbojW/dev/roochdb/rooch_store" "/tmp/.tmpJmbojW/dev/roochdb/moveos_store"
Rooch server storage successfully cleaned
```
