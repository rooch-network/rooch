# Get BTC test coin

We open the website to receive BTC test coins: https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet/

On the settings page of our UniSat wallet, switch the address type to a `non-Taproot` type. The current faucet does not currently support Taproot addresses to receive BTC test coins.

After waiting a few seconds, you can see the test coins received:

At this time, we will transfer the BTC test currency from the Native Segwit type address to the Taproot type address through transfer to facilitate subsequent testing.

After switching to the Taproot address, click to copy address:

> At this time, there is no BTC test coin!
