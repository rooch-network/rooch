# Rooch CLI

Learn how to set up, configure, and use the Rooch Command Line Interface (CLI). You can experiment with Rooch features through the Rooch CLI.

## Set up

When you install Rooch, the Rooch CLI will be installed. See the [installation](./installation.en-US.mdx) topic for prerequisites and installation instructions.

## Using the Rooch CLI

The Rooch CLI supports the following commands:

```shell
rooch 0.1.0
Rooch Contributors <opensource@rooch.network>

USAGE:
rooch <SUBCOMMAND>

    OPTIONS:
    -h, --help       Print help information
    -V, --version    Print version information

    SUBCOMMANDS:
    account        Tool for interacting with accounts
    event          Tool for interacting with event
    help           Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    init           Tool for init with rooch

```

Use `rooch -h` to see a list of supported commands.

Use `rooch help <COMMAND>` to see more information about a given command.

## Initialize the Rooch configuration

By default, The configuration file is saved in your home directory.

Use `rooch init` to initialize the Rooch account, the location of the configuration file is specified by `--config-dir`.

The response resembles the following:

```shell
Creating config file ["/Users/sven/.rooch/rooch_config/rooch.yaml"] with default (local) server and ed25519 key scheme.
Generated new keypair for address with scheme "ed25519" [0xeb417f9091c77c8c1a9c6a7683ee1eb5883fbae5128eae5ab414c0de5f050d08]
Secret Recovery Phrase : [grab infant behave ugly erosion grief file arrange unit ship iron garage]
"Rooch config file generated at /Users/sven/.rooch/rooch_config/rooch.yaml"
```

## Start the local network

Use `rooch server start` to start the local network.

**Important**: Each time you start the Rooch server, the network starts as a new network with no previous data. The local network is not persistent.

The response resembles the following:

```shell
Documentation generation successful!

```

## More Examples

### Account

Rooch account-related commands are invoked through `rooch account`, and account commands support the following subcommands:

```shell
rooch-account 
Tool for interacting with accounts

USAGE:
    rooch account [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>

OPTIONS:
        --client.config <CONFIG>    Sets the file storing the state of our user accounts (an empty
                                    one will be created if missing)
    -h, --help                      Print help information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    create     Create a new account on-chain
    help       Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    import     Add a new key to rooch.keystore based on the input mnemonic phrase
    list       List all keys by its Rooch address, Base64 encoded public key
    nullify    Nullify a keypair from a selected scheme with a Ed25519 generated address in
                   rooch.keystore
    switch     Switch the active Rooch account
    update     Update an address with a new keypair from scheme to rooch.keystore
```

Use `rooch account -h` to see a list of supported subcommands.

Use `rooch account help <SUBCOMMAND>` to see more information about a given subcommand.

#### Account Create

Use `rooch account create` command to create an account on Rooch Network.

The Rooch CLI command to create an account supports the following options:

```shell
rooch-account-create 
Create a new account on-chain

An account can be created by transferring coins, or by making an explicit call to create an account.
This will create an account with no coins, and any coins will have to transferred afterwards.

USAGE:
    rooch account create [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
        --config-dir <CONFIG_DIR>
            rooch config path

    -h, --help
            Print help information
```

If no path is specified via the `--config-dir` option, the account will be created at the default local file path, currently `~/.rooch/rooch_config/`.

It is worth noting that to create an account, the configuration file `rooch.yaml` must exist. The `rooch.yaml` file can be created with the `rooch init` command.

Here are the examples to create accounts with and without option `--config-dir`:

```shell
rooch account create
```

```shell
0xd2dfe9f6f61058a73353c904646ccc90104f06d9fb5711a8356bb2c2a222998a

}
```

At lines 1-2, the `rooch account create` command will generate a new key pair and create an address according to the `ed25519` scheme.

At line 3, a secret recovery phrase or mnemonic phrase associated with the address above is printed, used to recover the address. The mnemonic is equivalent to the password of the account. With the mnemonic, you can control the entire account.

At lines 4-57, a transaction is sent to the Rooch blockchain RPC server, where a corresponding response is returned.

Changes this transaction has made:

```shell
"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000": {
    "entries": {
        "0xd2dfe9f6f61058a73353c904646ccc90104f06d9fb5711a8356bb2c2a222998a": {
            "type": "new",
            "value": "0xd2dfe9f6f61058a73353c904646ccc90104f06d9fb5711a8356bb2c2a222998ad2dfe9f6f61058a73353c904646ccc90104f06d9fb5711a8356bb2c2a222998ac7d14a2ff97ecf1df90bb5698654817688e24107d9dde0ec7c703bfdab65f9256c97b072e626eda50af11f602437d06ffbf454fafec0f84afaecfbdcac00b9d7",
            "value_type": "0x2::object::Object<0x2::account_storage::AccountStorage>"
        }
    }
},
```

The first change indicates that an account storage is assigned to the address just created.

```shell
"0xc7d14a2ff97ecf1df90bb5698654817688e24107d9dde0ec7c703bfdab65f925": {
    "entries": {
        "0x52303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030303030333a3a6163636f756e743a3a4163636f756e74": {
            "type": "new",
            "value": "0x0100000000000000",
            "value_type": "0x3::account::Account"
        }
    }
}
```

The second change indicates that an account is created for the address just created.

You can also specify the `--config-dir` option to the account creation command to specify the configuration directory.

```shell
rooch account create --config-dir ~/.rooch/rooch_config/
```

Note that the account creation will fail with an HTTP error if the Rooch blockchain RPC server has not started:

```shell
Error: Networking or low-level protocol error: HTTP error: error trying to connect: tcp connect error: Connection refused (os error 61)
```

#### Account Switch

A default account will be created after the `rooch init` command, and another account will be created using `rooch account create`. At this time, there are two available accounts stored in `rooch.keystore`.

Use `rooch account switch` command to switch between accounts.

The Rooch CLI switch account command supports the following options:

```shell
rooch-account-switch 
Switch the active Rooch account

USAGE:
    rooch account switch [OPTIONS] --address <ADDRESS>

OPTIONS:
    -a, --address <ADDRESS>          The address of the Rooch account to be set as active
        --config-dir <CONFIG_DIR>    rooch config path
    -h, --help                       Print help information
```

Use `--address` or `-a` flag to specify an address to switch to.

Here's an example of switching to the created address:

```shell
rooch account switch --address 0xd2dfe9f6f61058a73353c904646ccc90104f06d9fb5711a8356bb2c2a222998a
```

Prompt message for successful switching:

```shell
The active account was successfully switched to `0xd2dfe9f6f61058a73353c904646ccc90104f06d9fb5711a8356bb2c2a222998a`
```

#### Account List

Use `rooch account list` command to check the account status.

The `rooch account list` command supports the following options:

```shell
rooch-account-list 
List all keys by its Rooch address, Base64 encoded public key

USAGE:
    rooch account list [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
        --config-dir <CONFIG_DIR>    rooch config path
    -h, --help                       Print help information
```

Use account list to check the address has successfully switched to `0xd2dfe9f6f61058a73353c904646ccc90104f06d9fb5711a8356bb2c2a222998a`.

```shell
rooch account list
```

```shell
                     Rooch Address (Ed25519)                       |               Public Key (Base64)                |      Scheme      | Active Address
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0x526793be899b13834a3df14a60003554232dc2886af71296a1a4e46edae814ed |   AGBscM9xRoM6ErRRpUfx/PXGQE0HvbW3pVku0fNTcPq3   |     ed25519      |             
0xd2dfe9f6f61058a73353c904646ccc90104f06d9fb5711a8356bb2c2a222998a |   AITD/sv7fsNvqwtT53l0PpsLjJdR6LIo1lVqy+PKL1Aa   |     ed25519      |     True    
```

With Active Address shown as `True` for Rooch Address `0xd2dfe9f6f61058a73353c904646ccc90104f06d9fb5711a8356bb2c2a222998a`, the address switch operation has been confirmed.

#### Account Import

Use `rooch account import` command to import an account from a mnemonic phrase.

The Rooch CLI account import command supports the following options:

```shell
rooch-account-import 
Add a new key to rooch.keystore based on the input mnemonic phrase

USAGE:
    rooch account import [OPTIONS] --mnemonic-phrase <MNEMONIC_PHRASE>

OPTIONS:
        --config-dir <CONFIG_DIR>              rooch config path
    -h, --help                                 Print help information
    -m, --mnemonic-phrase <MNEMONIC_PHRASE>
```

Use `--mnemonic-phrase` or `-m` flag to specify a mnemonic phrase to import an account. The account's address will be generated from the mnemonic phrase to an ed25519 address with an ed25519 key pair generated.

Import an account from a mnemonic phrase. The mnemonic phrase is generated from `rooch init` or `rooch account create` commands:

```shell
rooch account import --mnemonic-phrase "misery surprise pupil skull acid pretty loud tray wolf pride head adapt"
```

Prompt message for successful import:

```shell
"misery surprise pupil skull acid pretty loud tray wolf pride head adapt"
Key imported for address on scheme Ed25519: [0x3e1e8fbb603e0576dc16eb48fd70c389d52dc1a2867c21b7b98ad1ab8cc8fd33]
```

At line 1, it's the mnemonic phrase itself.

At line 2, a key pair is imported from the mnemonic phrase and an address is generated from the key pair with the default scheme ed25519.

Now, use `rooch account list` to check whether the newly imported address `0x3e1e8fbb603e0576dc16eb48fd70c389d52dc1a2867c21b7b98ad1ab8cc8fd33` is in the account:

```shell
rooch account list
```

```shell
                     Rooch Address (Ed25519)                       |               Public Key (Base64)                |      Scheme      | Active Address
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0x3e1e8fbb603e0576dc16eb48fd70c389d52dc1a2867c21b7b98ad1ab8cc8fd33 |   AMtU2I8OF3ArnnPJ2Yvcj11++cIWh+EbhZz4sMmGENZ7   |     ed25519      |             
0x526793be899b13834a3df14a60003554232dc2886af71296a1a4e46edae814ed |   AGBscM9xRoM6ErRRpUfx/PXGQE0HvbW3pVku0fNTcPq3   |     ed25519      |             
0xd2dfe9f6f61058a73353c904646ccc90104f06d9fb5711a8356bb2c2a222998a |   AITD/sv7fsNvqwtT53l0PpsLjJdR6LIo1lVqy+PKL1Aa   |     ed25519      |     True    
```

The command line output shows that the address `0x3e1e8fbb603e0576dc16eb48fd70c389d52dc1a2867c21b7b98ad1ab8cc8fd33` is successfully imported from a mnemonic phrase and it's in the account.

It's worth noting that when using `rooch account import` command, the mnemonic phrase should be quoted since it has white spaces between words.

#### Account Update

Use `rooch account update` command to update an address with a new key pair from a mnemonic phrase and a scheme.

The Rooch CLI account update command supports the following options:

```shell
rooch-account-update 
Update an address with a new keypair from scheme to rooch.keystore

USAGE:
    rooch account update [OPTIONS] --address <ADDRESS> --mnemonic-phrase <MNEMONIC_PHRASE> --scheme <CRYPTO_SCHEMES>

OPTIONS:
    -a, --address <ADDRESS>
            Rooch address in string format

        --config-dir <CONFIG_DIR>
            rooch config path

    -h, --help
            Print help information

    -m, --mnemonic-phrase <MNEMONIC_PHRASE>
            

    -s, --scheme <CRYPTO_SCHEMES>
            Command line input of crypto schemes (ed25519, multi-ed25519, ecdsa, ecdsa-recoverable
            or schnorr) [possible values: ed25519, multi-ed25519, ecdsa, ecdsa-recoverable, schnorr]
```

Use `--address` or `-a`, `--mnemonic-phrase` or `-m`, `--scheme` or `-s` option combinations to update an account's address.

`<ADDRESS>` can be taken from an existing address. Similarly, `<MNEMONIC_PHRASE>` can also be taken from an existing one.

`<CRYPTO_SCHEMES>` should be selected within the possible values scope.

Here's an example to update address `0xd2dfe9f6f61058a73353c904646ccc90104f06d9fb5711a8356bb2c2a222998a` with the `ecdsa` scheme and the corresponding mnemonic phrase `desert hedgehog moral long cost husband timber someone lunar knee clever brave` used to generate the address:

```shell
rooch account update --address 0xd2dfe9f6f61058a73353c904646ccc90104f06d9fb5711a8356bb2c2a222998a --scheme ecdsa --mnemonic-phrase "desert hedgehog moral long cost husband timber someone lunar knee clever brave"
```

```shell
"desert hedgehog moral long cost husband timber someone lunar knee clever brave"
0xd2dfe9f6f61058a73353c904646ccc90104f06d9fb5711a8356bb2c2a222998a
Generated a new keypair for an existing address 0xd2dfe9f6f61058a73353c904646ccc90104f06d9fb5711a8356bb2c2a222998a on scheme Ecdsa
```

At line 1, it's the mnemonic phrase from the input.

At line 2, it's the existing address from the input.

At line 3, it indicates a new key pair on scheme ecdsa is generated for the address `0xd2dfe9f6f61058a73353c904646ccc90104f06d9fb5711a8356bb2c2a222998a`.

Use `rooch account list` to check if a new key pair on scheme ecdsa is successfully added to the account.

```shell
rooch account list

```

The command line output shows that a new base64-encoded public key with scheme ecdsa is added to the address `0xd2dfe9f6f61058a73353c904646ccc90104f06d9fb5711a8356bb2c2a222998a` and it's activated.

The corresponding private key to the public key can be found at `rooch.keystore`. For example:

```shell
{
  "0x3e1e8fbb603e0576dc16eb48fd70c389d52dc1a2867c21b7b98ad1ab8cc8fd33": {
    "Ed25519": "AC4b1o0kj1/f0P2NWnYnMsZgglk4OxzOIo7xTUbr2vIY"
  },
  "0x526793be899b13834a3df14a60003554232dc2886af71296a1a4e46edae814ed": {
    "Ed25519": "AAbtuAUtIVgoYjMVru/fY0Ck42ZsgM3N3BUm/6BVFV+p"
  },
  "0xd2dfe9f6f61058a73353c904646ccc90104f06d9fb5711a8356bb2c2a222998a": {
    "Ed25519": "AHLz7D8uDvc/16MljntLfl0WGDoqgyK6bOUNyGbZW414",
    "Ecdsa": "At/6j9jqKsdhNSzJqMiT5knBNT7mwKGiF+mwmt2Qt6fF"
  }
}
```

They all belong to one address and an address can have multiple key pairs from different schemes. Thanks to the `rooch account update` command.

Beside all the above mentioned feature, `rooch account update` will also initiate a transaction to Rooch blockchain RPC server to rotate to an authentication key from the scheme specified.

For now, an authentication key is an address that is generated from a public key for each scheme, and only one authentication key exists at a time.

#### Account Nullify

Use `rooch account nullify` command to nullify an existing key pair from a scheme in an account's address.

The nullify account address command of the Rooch CLI supports the following options:

```shell
rooch-account-nullify 
Nullify a keypair from a selected scheme with a Ed25519 generated address in rooch.keystore

USAGE:
    rooch account nullify [OPTIONS] --address <ADDRESS> --scheme <CRYPTO_SCHEMES>

OPTIONS:
    -a, --address <ADDRESS>          Rooch address in string format
        --config-dir <CONFIG_DIR>    rooch config path
    -h, --help                       Print help information
    -s, --scheme <CRYPTO_SCHEMES>    Command line input of crypto schemes (ed25519, multied25519,
                                     ecdsa, ecdsa-recoverable or schnorr) [possible values: ed25519, multi-ed25519,
                                     ecdsa, ecdsa-recoverable, schnorr]
```

Use `--address` or `-a`, `--scheme` or `-s` option combinations to nullify a key pair in the account's address.

Same way, `<ADDRESS>` should be an existing address from the account, and `<CRYPTO_SCHEMES>` should be selected within the possible values.

Here's an example to nullify the key pair of the newly added ecdsa scheme:

```shell
rooch account nullify --address 0xd2dfe9f6f61058a73353c904646ccc90104f06d9fb5711a8356bb2c2a222998a --scheme ecdsa
```

```shell
0xd2dfe9f6f61058a73353c904646ccc90104f06d9fb5711a8356bb2c2a222998a
Dropped a keypair from an existing address 0xd2dfe9f6f61058a73353c904646ccc90104f06d9fb5711a8356bb2c2a222998a on scheme Ecdsa
```

At line 1, it's the address from the input.

At line 2, it indicates that a key pair of scheme ecdsa for the address `0xd2dfe9f6f61058a73353c904646ccc90104f06d9fb5711a8356bb2c2a222998a` has been dropped and deleted.

Use `rooch account list` to see if the key pair on ecdsa scheme has gone:

```shell
rooch account list
```

```shell
                     Rooch Address (Ed25519)                       |               Public Key (Base64)                |      Scheme      | Active Address
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0xd2dfe9f6f61058a73353c904646ccc90104f06d9fb5711a8356bb2c2a222998a |   AITD/sv7fsNvqwtT53l0PpsLjJdR6LIo1lVqy+PKL1Aa   |     ed25519      |     True    
```

The command line output shows that the ecdsa scheme has been removed from the account's address and the authentication key for the ecdsa scheme has also been dropped from the sender's account storage in Move through a transaction sent to the Rooch blockchain RPC server.

Also, check if the private key has been successfully removed from `rooch.keystore`:

```shell
cat ~/.rooch/rooch_config/rooch.keystore
```

```shell
{
  "0x3e1e8fbb603e0576dc16eb48fd70c389d52dc1a2867c21b7b98ad1ab8cc8fd33": {
    "Ed25519": "AC4b1o0kj1/f0P2NWnYnMsZgglk4OxzOIo7xTUbr2vIY"
  },
  "0x526793be899b13834a3df14a60003554232dc2886af71296a1a4e46edae814ed": {
    "Ed25519": "AAbtuAUtIVgoYjMVru/fY0Ck42ZsgM3N3BUm/6BVFV+p"
  },
  "0xd2dfe9f6f61058a73353c904646ccc90104f06d9fb5711a8356bb2c2a222998a": {
    "Ed25519": "AHLz7D8uDvc/16MljntLfl0WGDoqgyK6bOUNyGbZW414"
  }
}
```

The output shows that there are no scheme ecdsa and its private key exist in the account's address `0xd2dfe9f6f61058a73353c904646ccc90104f06d9fb5711a8356bb2c2a222998a`.
