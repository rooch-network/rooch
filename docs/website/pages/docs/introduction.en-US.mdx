Rooch (/ru ß/) is named by combining Root and Branch where both mean several things:

- from a community perspective, Rooch helps Web3 builders to build the roots of Web3 for different branches of users
- from an ecosystem perspective, Rooch creates a connection between crypto assets from different ecosystems and versatile Web3 DApps
- from a technical perspective, Rooch serves as the middle layer between all the Layer1 blockchains and all the Web3 DApps

Find out about our vision and why we build Rooch in the blog post "[From Web2.5 to Web3](/blog/from-web2.5-to-web3)"
