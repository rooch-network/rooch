# Storage

Rooch introduces the **StorageAbstraction** feature, which allows developers to define the state storage structure of their application more flexibly within smart contracts, rather than being limited to standardized solutions provided by the platform. This makes it more suitable for building Fully on-chain applications.

Key features of Rooch's storage abstraction are as follows:

1. It provides both global `Object` storage and user storage space (AccountStorage), allowing developers to partition storage based on their specific business requirements.
2. Developers can define access and extension restriction for storage structures using private generics, as explained in the [PrivateGenerics](../developer-guides/private-generics.en-US.mdx) guide.
3. It provides a foundation for future application-specific storage spaces and application-specific runtime containers.
