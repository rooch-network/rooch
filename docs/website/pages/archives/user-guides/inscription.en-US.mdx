# Inscription

This tutorial mainly introduces how to engrave inscriptions and how to view the inscribed inscription assets on Rooch.

## Inscribe tools

Here is an inscribe tool:

- BTC testnet：https://supertestnet.github.io/inscriptions-online/testnet
- BTC mainnet：https://supertestnet.github.io/inscriptions-online

> Currently Rooch has launched the advance network, please choose the first link for inscription!

## Prepare inscription materials

1. Make sure the UniSat wallet's Taproot type address already has BTC.

2. Create a hello.txt file and fill in the inscription information in JSON format:

```json
{"p":"brc-20","op":"mint","tick":"Rooch","amt":"10"}
```

## Start inscribe

Open the inscribe tool in your browser:

Fill in the Taproot type address, upload the `hello.txt` file you just prepared, and then click the `Submit` button:

Then the payment address will be displayed. We copy the payment address provided by the inscribe tool and pay the fee required for this inscribe to this address. Here is `1253` sats (equivalent to `0.00001253` BTC):

After the payment is completed, two links will be displayed. The first one is used to check the on-chain status of the transaction we just sent. It has not been confirmed yet and you need to wait for a few minutes:

## View the inscription on the Rooch dashboard

When the transaction is confirmed, we open the Rooch dashboard and click on the sidebar `My Assets` to view the UTXO object:

Next, click `Inscription` to view the inscription assets currently owned by the wallet:
