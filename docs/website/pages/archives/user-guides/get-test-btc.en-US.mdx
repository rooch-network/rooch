# Get BTC test coin

We open the website to receive BTC test coins: https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet/

On the settings page of our UniSat wallet, switch the address type to a `non-Taproot` type. The current faucet does not currently support Taproot addresses to receive BTC test coins.

> Tip: If there is a network agent, you can receive it once, switch to another agent node (if the IP address changes at this time, it will be recognized as a new device), and you can receive it again.

At this time, we will transfer the BTC test currency from the Native Segwit type address to the Taproot type address through transfer to facilitate subsequent testing.

After switching to the Taproot address, click to copy address:

> At this time, there is no BTC test coin!
