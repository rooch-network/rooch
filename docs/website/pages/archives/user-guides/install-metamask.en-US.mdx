# MetaMask

MetaMask is a browser extension-based wallet that runs in a web browser (Chrome, Firefox or Edge). MetaMask was originally developed as a browser wallet for the Ethereum blockchain. Now it can interact with the corresponding blockchain network as long as the blockchain network implements its relevant interfaces. The Rooch network currently supports the use of MetaMask to interact and manage crypto assets.
