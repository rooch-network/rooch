Rooch Network aims to enable seamless integration between two strong and rapidly growing communities: Move and Bitcoin. Powered by Rooch’s innovative tech stack, developers can, for the first time, build on Bitcoin using the advanced Move language, while users can enjoy secure and effortless Bitcoin DApps.

As a permissionless and decentralized protocol, Rooch Network relies on a crypto token-based economic system to maintain its functionality and operations, as well as to strengthen its community and ecosystem.

In this post, we're excited to introduce the tokenomics of Rooch Network and the official `$ROOCH` token.

## $ROOCH Token

Here is the basic information of the `$ROOCH` token:

- Ticker: `ROOCH`
- Total Supply: `10,000,000,000`
- Decimal: 12
- Token Format: Rooch Native Coin

`$ROOCH` token serves an  important role in the Rooch ecosystem. Its predefined function include:

- **Store of Value:** The `$ROOCH` token works seamlessly with `$RGAS`, the gas fee token of the Rooch Network. Users can deposit `$ROOCH` to borrow `$RGAS`. Additionally, 40% of all `$RGAS` consumed by the network will be used to repurchase and burn `$ROOCH`, enhancing its value.
- **Governance:** `$ROOCH` serves as the primary governance token within the Rooch ecosystem, empowering token holders to participate in key decision-making processes.
- **Network Security:** $ROOCH tokens are required as deposits for Rooch node operators to join and help secure the network.

### Token Release

In terms of token release, all $ROOCH tokens will be held in custody by smart contracts and released on a monthly basis.

- **Team Tokens:**
    
    These tokens will be locked for the first six months after the Token Generation Event (TGE) and will then be gradually unlocked for early backers and core contributors at varying speeds.
    
- **Ecosystem Tokens:**
    
    At the TGE, 3% of the total token supply will be unlocked, with the remainder linearly unlocked and put into use thereafter.
    
- **Community Tokens:**
    
    These tokens will be distributed to community members through various campaigns and programs. The release schedule depends on community participation. Initially, the Rooch Network team will design programs to release tokens from the smart contract. However, as the ecosystem grows, a decentralized governance mechanism will take over this function, determining the release of community tokens.
