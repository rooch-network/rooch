We’re excited to announce our collaboration with Portal to Bitcoin, the only custody-less interoperability protocol designed for Bitcoin, enabling fast and low-cost atomic swaps between native BTC assets and other L1s and L2s. This partnership represents a critical milestone in our journey to revolutionize cross-chain interoperability and enhance Bitcoin application development. Together, we’re laying the foundation for a new era of scalable, secure, and native Bitcoin solutions.

Rooch Network is committed to building the infrastructure needed to empower the Bitcoin ecosystem. With our unique Stackable L2 architecture powered by MoveVM, we’re enabling native Bitcoin applications and non-custodial yields for BTC in a completely decentralized manner. The partnership between Portal to Bitcoin aligns perfectly with our goal of making Rooch the premier application layer for Bitcoin by unlocking new layers of utility and scalability.
Now let’s explore how Portal and Rooch Network are elevating Bitcoin’s potential to new heights.

## Portal DEX: Bringing Seamless Cross-Chain Trading to Rooch

In our partnership with Portal, Rooch’s native tokens will be integrated into Portal DEX, allowing for one-click cross-chain atomic swaps involving native BTC and other L1 & L2 assets. By embedding Portal’s Swaps SDK directly into our infrastructure, Rooch Network enhances the trading experience across our ecosystem, providing wallets and DEXs with advanced liquidity routing and swap functionalities. This integration makes trading fast, secure, and trustless—perfectly aligned with Bitcoin’s decentralized principles.

## Collaborating on the Future of Bitcoin Atomic Swaps

The partnership also focuses on perfecting Bitcoin Atomic Swaps, making it easier for developers to adopt and deploy secure, decentralized cross-chain transactions. By working together, Rooch and Portal ensure that these swaps are more accessible, reliable, and efficient, reducing reliance on centralized intermediaries and elevating Bitcoin’s inherent trustlessness.

## Portal’s Commitment to Bitcoin’s Core Values

Portal’s mission to enhance Bitcoin’s ecosystem is deeply aligned with our goals at Rooch. By offering secure, non-custodial solutions for cross-chain transactions, Portal ensures that Bitcoin’s core values—self-sovereignty, security, and decentralization—remain intact. Together, we’re setting a new standard for what’s possible with Bitcoin applications and asset management.

## A New Era for the Bitcoin Ecosystem

This partnership between Rooch Network and Portal to Bitcoin represents a significant step forward in advancing Bitcoin’s potential. By integrating seamless cross-chain trading and pioneering innovations in Bitcoin Atomic Swaps, we are collectively pushing the boundaries of what decentralized finance can achieve. As we continue to build on Bitcoin’s core principles of security, self-sovereignty, and decentralization, Rooch Network remains dedicated to empowering developers and users with next-generation infrastructure. Together with Portal, we’re forging a future where Bitcoin applications are more scalable, efficient, and versatile than ever before. The evolution of Bitcoin starts here.
