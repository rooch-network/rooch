## 1 简单

Interactive Proof, aka Interactive Game, have become the de facto
standard for the arbitration mechanisms of Optimistic Rollups. By
providing a unified deterministic single-step execution environment for
both on-chain and off-chain through the use of intermediary
instructions, it minimizes resource requirements during on-chain
arbitration. Its inherent complexity leads us to simplify its
explanation for the sake of dissemination and comprehension. Let us
delve into just how simple it can be[^1].

### 1.1 同一语言，同一结果

**Moe**: Is `Uno mas uno es igual a dos` also true on your computer?

**Joe**: I don't understand Spanish, what did you mean? Could you describe
it in mathematical language that everyone could comprehend?

----

**Moe**: Is `1 + 1 = 2` also true on your computer?

**Joe**: Yes!

----

**Moe**: Is `1 + 1 = 2` also true on everyone's computer?

**Everyone**: Yes!

----

**Moe**: Is `(((1 + 1) + 1) + 1) = 4 ` also true on everyone's computer?

Everyone: Yes!

### 1.2 同一语言，步骤，两种结果

**Moe**: Is `(((1 + 1) + 1) + 1) = 5 ` also true on your computer?

**Joe**: No! It's 4.

----

**Moe**: I am inclined to assert the correctness of 5. Shall we entreat the
esteemed scholar, Lorentz[^2], to adjudicate the veracity of our claims?

**Joe**: Good. However, as Mr. Lorentz is rather preoccupied, we could
initially examine the first inconsistent step and delegate their
validation to him.

----

**Moe**: Could this work?

**Joe**: Yes. Every step is deterministic.

----

**Moe**: Let's start with first evaluation!

**Joe**: Okay!

...

**Moe** & **Joe**: In step 2, we have different result. A is `2 + 1 = 4`, B is
`2 +1 = 3`. Let's seek his help!

**Lorentz**: `2 + 1 = 3`

**Moe** & **Joe**: Thank you!

### 1.3 同一语言，步骤，两种结果，LogN 次核对

**Moe**: Is `(((1 + 1) + 1) + ... + 1) = 48784359345934` also true on
your computer?

**Joe**: No. The Value is 48784359345935.

----

**Moe**: Let's play the game again!

**Joe**: No way! Due to the communication overhead, each comparison requires
1 second. We may need 1.5 million years to finish the game.

----

**Moe**: The cost of computation is just 1 second. Emmmm, how about using
bisection?

**Joe**: Each comparison can resolve half of the issues. In this manner, we
can swiftly identify inconsistencies!

----

**Moe**: Step 24392179672966 is `24392179672966 + 1 = 24392179672967 `

**Joe**: Step 24392179672966 is `24392179672965 + 1 = 24392179672966 `

----

**Moe**: Step 12196089836483 is `12196089836483 + 1 = 12196089836484 `

**Joe**: Step 12196089836483 is `12196089836482 + 1 = 12196089836483 `

----

**Moe**: Step 6098044918241 is `6098044918241 + 1 = 6098044918242 `

**Joe**: Step 6098044918241 is `6098044918241 + 1 = 6098044918242 `. The
first inconsistent step must be in `(6098044918241, 12196089836483]`,
we're not far from our destination!

## 2 深入

In 'The Little' we have identified the three essential elements that
constitute the 'Interactive Game'：

> a. One Language

> b. Deterministic Step

> c. Bisection

One cannot help but wonder how such a simple protocol led numerous
Optimistic Rollups teams to spend so much time and energy on it? This is
akin to the time before the Wright brothers invented the airplane when
people already knew that the quickest way from point A to point B was
not traveling over mountains and valleys, but flying in a straight line.
The act of flying, like Bisection, is straightforward and simple. To
attract those who used to drive to fly instead, it's sufficient to
emphasize this point. However, for an aircraft engineer, it is evident
that there is much more to know.

### 2.1 同一语言

**Moe**: We require a language that supports the operation of blockchain
clients and yields results consistent with the client on the chain.

**Joe**: Done! For Ethereum, it's Solidity!

----

**Moe**: How do you intend to handle these instructions that depend on
spacetime? Such as: CALLER, SLOAD, SSTORE, BLOCKTIME.

**Joe**: Emmm... I can't tell you right now, but there is always a way,
isn't there?

----

**Moe**: Optimism has tried that but failed.

**Joe**: Sad story. Thanks for their contribution.

----

**Moe**: We could emulate the execution container of a language. How about
EVM-in-EVM?

**Joe**: Sounds not bad. But how about the cost of Gas? I don't think it's an
easy job to emulate memory and storage in Solidity.

----

**Moe**: We need a medium, just like we've done with mathematical language.

**Joe**: I think we're closer to the answer.

----

**Moe**: Client could be compiled to this language. And we could emulate
this language on chain.

**Joe**: Ideally, it should be an assembly language, as emulating the
execution of instructions is always simpler.

### 2.2 确定性步骤

**Moe**: By utilizing a certain language, we can roughly achieve certainty
in computation. Thus, the problem to be addressed now is the certainty
of input and state changes.

**Joe**: Generally speaking, we employ an Oracle to resolve issues related
to external information input.

----

**Moe**: Could this Oracle be deterministic for both of L1 and L2?

**Joe**: We have root on L1, which means we have chance to verify input.

----

**Moe**: Is it possible to illustrate our current achievements with a
figure?

**Joe**:
Sure! 

<img src="/blog/interactive-game/timeline.png" width = "500" height = "300" alt="timeline" align=center />

----

**Moe**: Could you explain this figure more?

**Joe**: 

> Pre-execution: fetch input by block_hash

> Load Emulator: setup execution environment

> Verify Input: verify input with witness

> Transition: execute L2 tx

----

**Moe**: Sounds we've already had everything!

**Joe**: Almost.

### 2.3 对分法

**Moe**: As the most straightforward segment, there appears to be little
worth discussing.

**Joe**: We need to ascertain the validity of the witness.

----

**Moe**: Signature is not enough?

**Joe**: No. Some may choose to feign deafness and muteness.

----

**Moe**: Okay. L1 should verify witness in each bisection round.

**Joe**: Yes. And L1 could not only have inconsistent STEP<sub>i</sub>, also have last consistent STEP<sub>i-1</sub> after bisection.

## 3 丑陋

In 'The Seasoned', we have refined the three essential elements that
constitute the 'Interactive Game'：

> a. One Language: simple assembly which could be run in off-chain client
and be emulated on chain.

> b. Deterministic Step: verify input with witness.

> c. Bisection: verify witness in each round.

Until now, the Interactive Game has been endearing and intricate.
However, to make it truly functional, we must unveil its ugly side.

### 3.1 同一语言： RISC

**Moe**: It appears we have a plethora of choices, such as MIPS, RISC-V, and
even Wasm.

**Joe**: We can design a flexible architecture to support various languages.
However, only one can be utilized at any given moment.

----

**Moe**: Which one would be your preferred choice?

**Joe**: MIPS. But in two years it will be RISC-V.

----

**Moe**: Your unpredictability leaves me perplexed.

**Joe**: I'm a reasonable man, and I am about to elucidate my rationale to
you. Firstly, the abstraction level of emulating CPU instructions is
quite low. While it may appear abstruse, it actually entails a lesser
cognitive load due to the absence of multiple layers of abstraction,
hence my lack of enthusiasm for Wasm.

----

**Moe**: That seems reasonably sound.

**Joe**: Among CPU instruction sets, RISC instruction sets are undoubtedly a
superior choice, owing to their limited and stable number of
instructions, and the evasion of the complexity of emulating intricate
instructions. In particular, the load-store architecture precludes the
emergence of memory side effects within ALU operations. It is essential
to note that every step of memory state change in our emulator requires
tracking, and thus the hardship of implementing register-memory
architecture may merely result in an infinity of bugs. Considering the
maturity and stability of compilers, I lean towards MIPS.

----

**Moe**: Tell me more about RISC-V.

**Joe**: We could have a 64-bit address space, as the 4GB memory space
provided by MIPS 32-bit can sometimes prove inadequate. However,
regardless of the instruction set used, we must take care to verify the
correctness of the implementation.

----

**Moe**: How will system calls be implemented? Indeed, it could pose a
formidable issue. 

**Joe**: However, we can cleverly construct our program to minimize the use 
of system calls, deploying our own system call implementations to replace
generic ones. Our primary demand is to maintain consistency in state
changes on and off the chain, rather than to create a universal emulator.

----

**Moe**: When I mention system calls, I am actually referring to the
non-deterministic factors in the language. System calls represent a form
of interaction between the emulator and the outside world, and such
interaction could imply non-determinism. You mentioned the method of
minimizing and customizing system calls, which, while not specific, is
indeed feasible considering that all aspects of the emulator lie in the
hands of the implementer. However, I remain apprehensive, feeling that
there are many non-deterministic factors that I have not yet considered.

**Joe**: I perceive your concerns, and you have even begun contemplating
issues of the next phase. Let us first postulate that we already possess
such a medium and continue this discussion in the following section.

----

**Moe**: The intermediary representation appears to be impartial towards all
chains, which sounds immensely promising.

**Joe**: Indeed. We can implement its emulator on various chains, thus
enabling various chains to have an Interactive Game. I've heard of a
project that's doing just that.

----

**Moe**: [Rooch/flexEmu](https://github.com/rooch-network/flexEmu)

**Joe**: Exactly it!

### 3.2 确定性步骤: 过程, 输入

**Moe**: Let's proceed swiftly, as the earlier segment regarding language
has not yet been fully discussed.

**Joe**: Indeed, we need to delve deeper into the determinacy of language.

----

**Moe**: When we discuss the determinacy of assembly language, we are in
fact addressing the determinacy of instructions.

**Joe**: Instruction is composed of opcode and operand. These are the two
primary sources of determinacy issues: the micro-level manifestations of
procedure and input at the level of instructions. We have briefly
discussed input in 'The Seasoned' and will delve into a detailed
analysis shortly. First, we need to ensure the uniqueness of instruction
side effects.

----

**Moe**: Concurrency will be a serious issue.

**Joe**: Yes. The output (state root) produced by emulator must be as same
as the one calculated by parallel executor in production environment.

----

**Moe**: How do we ensure the determinacy of concurrent execution in every
step?

**Joe**: Dr.Strange[^3] could help us.

----

**Moe**: Are you serious?

**Joe**: No, I'm Joe. We can't do that, and our purpose is not to build such a
system. What we want is to get the same final state and maintain the
same step state among emulators.

----

**Moe**: Oh, yes. It's not a hard job to achieve the same final state. We
just need...

**Joe**: Sequencer should give each tx an order number. Tx that are causally
unrelated can be executed in parallel, while those that are causally
related must be executed strictly in sequence. In this manner, the final
state will be consistent with a global sequential execution.

----

**Moe**: Now, we can confidently eliminate the impact of concurrency on the
side effects of instructions.

**Joe**: In addition to concurrent transactions, there are many units of
concurrent execution in the process.

----

**Moe**: The easiest way to do this is to force the emulator to execute
on a single thread.

**Joe**: Yes.

----

**Moe**: Randomness is another element of instability.

**Joe**: Let's start analysing the world of instructions from the bottom
up.

----

**Moe**: There is no opcode supporting random operation directly in RISC
family. For related system calls, we can embed a fixed random data
source within the emulator. This way, each emulator can achieve
consistent pseudorandom numbers in the same procedure.

**Joe**: Nothing wrong with.

----

**Moe**: Linux Kernel hates float. Does emulator hate that too?

**Joe**: We could use SoftFloat Library or just forbidden it.

----

**Moe**: Sounds like we've prepared everything for deterministic procedure.

**Joe**: Not enough yet. Do not forget that procedures cannot prove their
own innocence.

----

**Moe**: L1 can validate static procedures, requiring only a digest. Prior
to the commencement of the Interactive Game, the L1 contract will verify
whether a consistent procedure has been used by the two parties through
the validation of their memory states.

**Joe**: Indeed. This is akin to a verifiable boot process. The memory
address of the boot sector is fixed, and both parties only need to
provide a simple merkle tree proof.

----

**Moe**: You just mentioned that there are
additional points to be made regarding the issue with input.

**Joe**: Indeed. I would like to reiterate the importance of the verifiable
'verification of the input process'. The off-chain verification
process for input must be traceable in single steps, so that the initial
state of the input can be legitimized. As part of the memory state, if
the input data loaded is deliberately tampered with, it will lead to the
inability to provide a proof of the state tree, as tampering implies
that the preceding instructions have produced side effects. However, in
the case of consistent initial states, malicious nodes cannot provide
side effect instructions to prove their innocence.

----

**Moe**: It does sound a bit convoluted, but I comprehend your meaning. The
crux is to ensure the determinacy of the input, and combined with the
determinacy of the procedure, we can only have deterministic single-step
states. It seems impregnable.

**Joe**: We also have the issue of 'Unconscious Evil', a problem that is
easily overlooked.

----

**Moe**: As your counterpart, I understand
your point. Achieving determinacy means we are implementing pure
rationality that relies on a physical medium. Possessing pure
rationality alone should not lead to complacency, causing us to overlook
the physical constraints.

**Joe**: Exactly. Blockchain networks are resilient to silent errors, as
nodes provide ample redundancy in the verification process. However, the
simple blockchain itself does not possess this property. In the
asynchronous validation of L2, silent errors can result in honest but
erroneous nodes being penalized.

----

**Moe**: The occurrence of silent errors is as inevitable as the sun rising
in the east and setting in the west. Therefore, we need to proactively
create redundancy. For instance, we can utilize physical machines with
different architectures to collectively compute the same process, and
use the aggregated results as the output of the current node. Cloud
service providers are already well-versed in similar tasks.

**Joe**: Now we can say we have deterministic step.

### 3.3 二分法: 头等舱机票

**Moe**: Bisection is the most discussed topic as it is a direct challenge
in the interactive game. However, it now seems to be a foregone
conclusion.

**Joe**: It is a direct issue as it directly exhibits the interactive
behaviors, yet the answer is indirect. It relies on an appropriate
intermediary language medium and the implementation of deterministic
language execution.

----

**Moe**: This reminds me of the previous analogy about airplanes. Now we
have the airplane, we just need to purchase the tickets.

**Joe**: Give me a first-class ticket, thank you!

## 附录 A: 当模拟器在模拟时它在模拟什么

**Joe**: Let me start this time.

**Moe**: Go ahead.

----

**Moe**: Observe what instructions this source code will morph into on your
machine:

<img src="/blog/interactive-game/ones-count.png" width = "600" height = "300" alt="ones-count" align=center />

**Joe**: You've preemptively spoken again. On my x86_64:

<img src="/blog/interactive-game/ones-count-x86.png" width = "600" height = "600" alt="ones-count-x86" align=center />

Or：

<img src="/blog/interactive-game/ones-count-simd.png" width = "600" height = "276" alt="ones-count-simd" align=center />

----

**Moe**: Because I showed you source code. Talking is cheap. On my RISC-V:

<img src="/blog/interactive-game/ones-count-riscv.png" width = "283" height = "600" alt="ones-count-riscv" align=center />

**Joe**: In the face of identical inputs, despite the vast differences in
the instructions our machines execute, they still manage to yield
identical outputs.

----

**Moe**: Is it you who is mirroring me, or am I the one replicating you?

**Joe**: That is the question.
