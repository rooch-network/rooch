## Introduction

Rooch Portal, as the portal of Rooch ecological applications, provides one-stop services such as asset management, asset exchange, and application interaction.

- Visit linkï¼šhttps://portal.rooch.network

## Create session key

Session Key is a feature provided by Rooch, which provides a convenient experience for the interaction of blockchain applications. Using Portal also requires generating a Session Key.

Please click the `Create Session Key` button in the lower left corner. After the wallet is signed, a time-limited Session Key will be generated. You need to ensure that the account has `RGAS`.

## Component introduction

### Account
