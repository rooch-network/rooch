## Introduction

Currently, Rooch Portal supports OneKey wallet, but there are a few points that need to be paid attention to when using it. Next, the usage process of OneKey wallet will be demonstrated.

## Install

Take Google Chrome as an example, install the OneKey browser plug-in: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/onekey/jnmbobjmhlngoefaiojfljckilhhlhcj?hl=en-US

Once the installation is complete, you can choose to create or import a wallet:

Taking creating a wallet as an example, you are first required to set a password to unlock the wallet locally:

Click `Show recovery phrase` and record the new walletâ€™s mnemonic phrase:

You will then enter the main interface of the OneKey multi-chain wallet:

## Things to note when using Rooch Portal

Click `Connect Wallet` in [Rooch Portal](portal.rooch.network) to connect the OneKey wallet:

OneKey uses Nested SegWit type Bitcoin addresses by default, while Rooch uses Taproot type addresses, so the correct address must be chosen to interact with the Rooch network.

Click the drop-down bar of the address to enter the interface for switching address types:

After entering, click the icon in the upper right corner and select the `Taproot` type:

After selecting, click on the upper left corner to return:

Click the `Approve` button to connect successfully:

After the connection is successful, it will be displayed normally on Rooch Portal!

If you select the wrong address type, click on the OneKey wallet, then click on the disconnect button and re-use the above steps.
