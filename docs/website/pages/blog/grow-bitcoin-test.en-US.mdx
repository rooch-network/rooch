## Introduction

Grow Bitcoin is an ecosystem acceleration platform that focuses on connecting the Bitcoin users and stakers to the projects. Grow Bitcoin is operated by the Rooch Network team.

As a Bitcoin staker or user, you get to earn BitXP as well as the project XP by voting for the projects you like, with your Bitcoin as the stake but without having to move your Bitcoin at all.

As a Bitcoin project builder, you are free to list your project on the Grow Bitcoin platform and get attentions from potential Bitcoin users; users will endorse your project with their votes and with more votes you get to earn BitXP as well!
