**Rooch Network, the application layer of Bitcoin, is thrilled to announce its strategic partnership with Avail, a modular blockchain solution designed to unify web3 and optimize data availability (DA) for highly scalable and customizable rollups.** By integrating Rooch Network’s asset-centric infrastructure with Avail’s state-of-the-art Data Availability (DA) layer, we are setting a new standard for blockchain scalability, efficiency, and interoperability.

**At its core, Rooch Network serves as the application layer of Bitcoin, offering an Asset-Centric infrastructure that provides indexing, trading, and application scenarios for all Bitcoin assets.** With a mission to unlock infinite utility for the Bitcoin Economy, Rooch Network is committed to revolutionizing the blockchain industry as we know it.

**Central to Avail's offerings is Avail DA, a foundational DA layer that implements cutting-edge technology, including KZG Commitments and Data Availability Sampling (DAS).** Avail DA revolutionizes blockchain data availability by enabling light clients to easily verify data through sampling over a peer-to-peer network, enhancing security and efficiency for developers. Avail’s efficient and scalable DA solutions pair perfectly with alt-VMs, especially the hyper-performant MoveVM, enabling developers on the Rooch Network to deploy production-ready code confidently and without the looming threat of costly security vulnerabilities.

**By integrating Avail’s DA into Rooch Network's infrastructure, developers will gain access to advanced data availability features, empowering them to build scalable, secure, and efficient blockchain applications.** The partnership between Rooch Network and Avail marks a significant milestone in the evolution of Web3 and decentralized applications. With Avail’s commitment to a robust and scalable blockchain infrastructure and Rooch Network’s focus on enhancing smart contract security, developers are poised to create unique and impactful online experiences accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
Last but not least, Rooch Network will launch its pre-mainnet soon and Avail's final test network, Turing, has just gone live paving the way for the imminent Avail DA mainnet launch. Stay tuned for further updates as Rooch Network and Avail continue to push the boundaries of blockchain technology and drive the adoption of decentralized solutions.

## About Avail

Avail is led by Polygon’s former co-founder Anurag Arjun and is building a unification layer to solve rollup fragmentation at scale. Avail addresses this from first principles solving blockchain scalability with Avail DA, a foundational DA layer which implements the same technology planned for Ethereum’s danksharding roadmap, including KZG Commitments and Data Availability Sampling (DAS). Avail Nexus addresses growing fragmentation concerns with permissionless interoperability, leveraging proof aggregation on Avail’s scalable DA layer. Avail’s security is then reinforced with multi-asset staking through Avail Fusion. Start your unification journey today at `availproject.org`
