Rooch implements the Bitcoin relay network and provides basic support for becoming the Bitcoin network execution layer.
Implement the analysis of transaction type, transaction progress, address, balance, inscription, UTXO, etc.

## Next step goal

1. Provide a per-manent incentive test network so that developers can deploy applications on it and let users try it out.
2. Run the RoochBTC pioneer network to achieve indexing of Bitcoin mainnet assets. For a detailed description of this goal, see [RoochBTC - Implementing Bitcoin's second layer with an on-chain indexer](https://rooch.network/zh-CN/blog/rooch-btc).

## Conclusion

Rooch's milestones are driven by application scenarios, focusing on the experience of developers and users. The goal is to expand the boundaries of Web3 applications and explore the possibilities of mass adoption.
