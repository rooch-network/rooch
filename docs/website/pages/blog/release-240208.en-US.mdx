## DA

Rooch currently implements the DA open network framework and can support the following scenarios in the future:

* Can be connected to DA Chain like Celestia
* You can also access cloud storage as a fast storage medium
* You can also enable local storage for testing or caching services
* Collaborative work, multiple DA backends can work together within an open network to achieve high reliability while meeting different needs.

## Bitcoin support

Connect to the Bitcoin test network and use UniSat as the default wallet. For detailed usage, please refer to Installing UniSat.
Rooch implements the Bitcoin relay network and provides basic support for becoming the Bitcoin network execution layer.
Implement the analysis of transaction type, transaction progress, address, balance, inscription, UTXO, etc.

## Object storage

This version has made a major reconstruction of object storage. Please refer to the [Object](../learn/core-concepts/objects/object) for detailed usage to provide developers with a better development experience.

How to use the test network, please refer to the document: [Connect to the test network](../build/getting-started/connect-to-rooch/connect-testnet)

## Next step goal

1. Provide a per-manent incentive test network so that developers can deploy applications on it and let users try it out.
2. Run the RoochBTC pioneer network to achieve indexing of Bitcoin mainnet assets. For a detailed description of this goal, see [RoochBTC - Implementing Bitcoin's second layer with an on-chain indexer](https://rooch.network/zh-CN/blog/rooch-btc).

## Conclusion

Rooch's milestones are driven by application scenarios, focusing on the experience of developers and users. The goal is to expand the boundaries of Web3 applications and explore the possibilities of mass adoption.
