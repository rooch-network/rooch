**We’re excited to announce a strategic partnership between Rooch Network and Solv Protocol, a leader in Bitcoin staking powered by the innovative Staking Abstraction Layer (SAL). This collaboration not only enhances the utility of Bitcoin but also introduces new, valuable yield opportunities for SolvBTC holders, pushing the boundaries of decentralized finance.**

Solv Protocol has firmly established itself as a frontrunner in Bitcoin staking, amassing over $2.4 billion in total value locked (TVL) and staking more than 25,000 BTC. Through SolvBTC, its flagship product and a Bitcoin Reserve for everyone, Solv Protocol aims to unlock the full potential of over $1 trillion in Bitcoin assets. With SolvBTC Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), Bitcoin holders can access diverse yield-generating opportunities while maintaining liquidity, enabling seamless participation in DeFi ecosystems. Solv is paving the way for institutional and traditional funds to confidently enter the world of Bitcoin Finance (BTCFi), bridging the gap between crypto and mainstream finance.

As the leading Bitcoin Application Layer featuring MoveVM and Bitcoin staking, Rooch Network brings native Bitcoin applications and yield generation into a fully non-custodial environment. By partnering with Solv Protocol, Rooch opens up new possibilities for Bitcoin holders, offering innovative use cases, greater liquidity, and enhanced yield opportunities across the ecosystem.


## Rooch Network Unlocks Utility and Yields for SolvBTC

**Rooch Network will contribute to the Solv ecosystem by providing innovative use cases and scenarios for SolvBTC holders.** Specifically, SolvBTC will be directly integrated into DeFi, GameFi, and other applications within the Rooch ecosystem. SolvBTC holders will gain access to unique yield mechanisms and a dynamic rewards ecosystem on Rooch Network. This collaboration is expected to foster Bitcoin-based finance (BTCFi), enhance the Bitcoin staking experience, and introduce new native Bitcoin applications for Bitcoin holders.


## Joint Exploration of a Native Staking Protocol for Bitcoin Layer 1 

In addition to integrating SolvBTC into Rooch’s ecosystem, **Rooch Network and Solv Protocol will jointly explore a native staking protocol for Bitcoin Layer 1, paving the way for the mass adoption of Bitcoin staking.**

Solv Protocol’s newly launched Staking Abstraction Layer (SAL) is a suite of smart contracts aimed at simplifying and standardizing Bitcoin staking across chains. It facilitates seamless interaction between Bitcoin mainnet and EVM-compatible chains while integrating with LST issuers, staking protocols, and validators. Building on this foundation, Rooch Network and Solv Protocol will explore SAL’s compatibility with MoveVM and develop a native staking protocol for Bitcoin Layer 1. This initiative aims to improve interoperability within the Bitcoin staking landscape, making it more accessible to all users.

## What’s Next?

In the coming weeks, Rooch Network will launch its pre-mainnet and provide real yield and utility for the Bitcoin ecosystem. Integrating with Solv Protocol is part of our commitment to expanding the utility and yield of BTC across various blockchain ecosystems. We invite BTC holders to engage in this innovative solution, sharing in the economic security and rewards of a more decentralized future.
