## Introduction

Grow Bitcoin is an ecosystem acceleration platform that focuses on connecting the Bitcoin users and stakers to the projects. Grow Bitcoin is operated by the Rooch Network team.

As a Bitcoin staker or user, you get to earn BitXP as well as the project XP by voting for the projects you like, with your Bitcoin as the stake but without having to move your Bitcoin at all.

As a Bitcoin project builder, you are free to list your project on the Grow Bitcoin platform and get attentions from potential Bitcoin users; users will endorse your project with their votes and with more votes you get to earn BitXP as well!

## Connect wallet

Click the `Connect Wallet` button to connect to the Bitcoin wallet, taking the UniSat wallet as an example for subsequent interactions.

Click the `Connect` button to authorize.

## Claim RGas

### Method 1

Make sure you have UTXOs in your Bitcoin wallet, no matter how many.

Rooch provides the mainnet RGas faucet in the Portal. Each new Bitcoin address can claim `RGas` once. You can `Claim` your `RGas` at this URL:

- RGas Faucet: https://portal.rooch.network/faucet

After `Claim`, you will receive `1 ~ 3` RGas, which can be viewed through the `Account` page.

### Method 2

If you have no UTXO, that is, no BTC balance, then you can bind the X (original Twitter) account in [Rooch Portal](https://portal.rooch.network/settings) and get `3` RGas.

For the specific process, please refer to the [Setting page of Portal](https://portal.rooch.network/settings). The working principle is to copy the tweet content to X (original Twitter). After successfully sending, copy the link of the tweet, paste it into the box, click `Verify and bind Twitter account` button and sign the transaction to bind successfully. Check your `Account` page at this time and you should be able to see a balance of `3` Rgas.

### Method 3

Invite other users to obtain `Rgas` invitation benefits. For details, please refer to the [Invitation page](https://portal.rooch.network/invitation/) in the Portal.

- You can click `Copy Invite Link` to directly send the invitation link to your friend and ask him to bind the X account. While he gets `RGas`, you will also get `RGas` share of the income.
  - Your friend will get `1 ~ 3` RGas based on the balance of BTC in the wallet. The more BTC means you will have a greater chance of getting `3` RGas.
  - And you will receive `5` RGas and a lottery ticket, which can be viewed by clicking the `Lottery Tickets` button.
- You can also click the `Invite With Twitter` button to send your invitation post to X. As long as other users bind X through the link in your post, you can also get `RGas` share revenue (same as above).

## Interaction

Here is how to stake the `BTC` assets in your wallet and obtain `GROW` assets.

If you have not created a Session Key, you will be prompted to create a Session Key first. At this time you need to sign, click the `Sign` button to authorize:

After waiting for a period of time, you can collect the staking rewards.

After claiming `GROW` rewards, you can click the `unStake` button to unstake your `BTC`.

### View assets

We can view `GROW` assets and other asset information on the `My Portfolio` page.

![](/blog/grow-bitcoin/my-portfolio.png)

`$GROW Balance` shows the `GROW` asset value I obtained, and `$RGAS Balance` shows the number of `RGas`.

### Vote for projects and get XP

We click `Projects` to enter the page for voting for Bitcoin ecological projects.

Choose a project you like or that can bring you value, vote for it, and earn `BitXP`.

Taking the UniSat wallet as an example, enter the project details page. Your `GROW` balance will be displayed here. I invested `500 GROW` for UniSat.

Clicking the `Vote` button will consume `500 GROW` and obtain the same amount of `BitXP`.

At this point, enter the `My Portfolio` page and you will be able to see the `XP` you have earned.
