Rooch Network, the native application layer for the Bitcoin ecosystem, is excited to announce our collaboration with Nubit, the leading Bitcoin-native Data Availability (DA) layer, poised to enable unlimited innovations with the most secure and scalable DA solution.  This strategic collaboration marks a significant step towards advancing the security and scalability of the Bitcoin ecosystem.  

Nubit is a scalable, cost-efficient, data availability layer secured by Bitcoin for the Bitcoin community. Nubit enables the scaling of Bitcoin's data capacities, empowering applications like Ordinals, Layer 2s, and price oracles, thus broadening the scope and efficiency of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Nubit aims to fully inherit the security of Bitcoin, including economic security, temper resistance, and censorship resistance, and innovates in consensus mechanisms and data availability. With Nubit, applications and users in the Bitcoin ecosystem can enjoy a data availability layer solution secured by Bitcoin's proven security. 
At its core, Rooch Network is a native application layer for the Bitcoin ecosystem, based on the Stackable L2 solution. It serves as the go-to launchpad for Bitcoin assets and the infrastructure for Bitcoin applications for users and developers. With a mission to unlock infinite utility for the Bitcoin economy, Rooch Network is committed to revolutionizing the blockchain industry.

## Rooch Network Will Integrate Nubit DA

A key area of collaboration between Rooch Network and Nubit is integrating Rooch Network’s asset-centric infrastructure with Nubit’s advanced DA solutions. **Specifically, Rooch will implement the Nubit DA interface within the Rooch node, making the Nubit DA an out-of-box choice for any Rooch Network validators.**

With this integration, developers will access advanced data availability features, empowering them to build scalable, secure, and efficient blockchain applications. Moreover, users can also verify their transactions, published with Nubit DA, on Rooch Network's pre-mainnet and mainnet. This ensures a transparent and secure environment for all users, fostering trust and reliability in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

## Collaborate on Developing the Next-Gen CSV Assets Standard 

**On the other side of the collaboration, Rooch Network is working with Nubit to develop a better CSV assets protocol that this industry deserves.** The Bitcoin ecosystem was initiated with innovations around the concept that we store arbitrary assets on Bitcoin - the most secure store of value. However, it has suffered from a lack of application scenarios due to the limitation of the Bitcoin blockchain’s programmability. **We believe that it is only fair to come up with a new CSV asset standard that is both Bitcoin-Native and easy-to-program. Together, the indexer solutions that are being implemented by both Rooch and Nubit will support this new asset standard to grow its adoption.**

## Upcoming Rooch Network &  Nubit Joint Campaign 

**Furthermore, Rooch Network and Nubit are gearing up to launch a joint campaign on the Nubit testnet.** This campaign will showcase the enhanced capabilities resulting from the partnership, allowing users to interact with both Rooch Network and Nubit and see the DA submitted to Nubit.  

Together, we’re unlocking new possibilities for the Bitcoin ecosystem, offering developers unparalleled opportunities to build scalable and secure blockchain applications. Users will benefit from enhanced transparency, security, and efficiency in their transactions and interactions within the ecosystem. We’re excited about the positive impact our partnership will have on the Bitcoin community and look forward to driving innovation together!
