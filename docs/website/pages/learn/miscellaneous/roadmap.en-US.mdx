## Rooch Milestones

We have named these milestones via the stages of plant growth, aiming for Rooch to grow from a seed to a towering tree, becoming the application layer of Bitcoin Ecosystem.

### Seeding -- 2023 Q1

Complete technical design and implementation for verifiable execution container with MoveVM and DSTP.
* Launch Rooch v0.3 Testnet

### Sprouting -- 2023 Q2

Adding Bitcoin state into DSTP and drive adoption by encouraging the innovation on Bitcoin based asset protocols.
* Launch Rooch v0.4 Testnet
* Launch Rooch Pre-Mainnet
* Launch Bitseed Protocol for experimenting CSV assets leaping

### Rooting -- 2023 Q3

Build more individual Rooch nodes by partnering with versatile communities, and let the assets grow freely in each of them. Build a DSTP based peer-to-peer network to connect all Rooch nodes into a single network, allowing the states to be shared between all nodes.

* Connect to DA

### Branching -- 2023 Q4

Find the security source for the network and build the security mechanism.
