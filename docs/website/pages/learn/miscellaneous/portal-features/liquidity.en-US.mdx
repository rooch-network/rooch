# Liquidity using guide

## Introduction

LP tokens can be used to earn compound interest in liquidity mining, take out cryptocurrency loans, or transfer ownership of staking liquidity.

Rooch now launches staking for `RGas` and `GROW` token pairs, and follows up with a simple demo to show the staking process.

## Staking process

Enter the Portal page, select `Liquidity` and click on the `Add` button on the right:

Just fill in the `RGas` and the LP pair will automatically calculate the `GROW` dosage:

The amount is calculated based on the official Swap pool, and the calculation form is:

```
point = x / x pool * 100%
y = y pool * point
```

## Earn token pairs

After forming an LP, you can stake the LP to Farm to obtain the income of the token pair. If you simply form a token pair, there will be no income.

After staking an LP, you can obtain `$LPXP` income.

In the future, $LPXP can be used to exchange initial liquidity to support this part of $ROOCH token, accounting for %5 of the total. For details, please refer to [this article](https://rooch.network/blog/rooch-network-tokenomics#community).
