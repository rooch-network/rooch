# Liquidity using guide

## Introduction

LP (Liquidity Provider) refers to token holders who combine two different tokens (such as `RGas` and `GROW`) into a token pair and stake it in Rooch’s liquidity pool (Farm). These pools receive liquidity from `RGas` and `GROW`, and liquidity providers are rewarded based on their contribution to the pool (in the form of `$LPXP`). Users holding `$LPXP` will have the opportunity to receive `$ROOCH` airdrops in the future.

Rooch now launches staking for `RGas` and `GROW` token pairs, and follows up with a simple demo to show the staking process.

## Staking process

Enter the Portal page, select `Liquidity` and click on the `Add` button on the right:

Just fill in the `RGas` and the LP pair will automatically calculate the `GROW` dosage:

The amount is calculated based on the official Swap pool, and the calculation formula is:

```
amount-in-with-fee = amount-in * fee-rate
amount-out = (amount-in-with-fee * reserve-out) / (reserve-in * 10000 + amount-in-with-fee)
```

Click the `Remove` button on the right to unstaking:

The calculation formula for group LP pairs:

```
point = x / x pool * 100%
y = y pool * point
```

## Earn token pairs

After forming an LP, you can stake the LP to Farm to obtain the income of the token pair. If you simply form a token pair, there will be no income.

Click the `Stake LP` button to stake token pairs:

After staking an LP, you can obtain `$LPXP` income.

In the [Rooch Network Tokenomics](https://rooch.network/blog/rooch-network-tokenomics) article released by Rooch, `5%` of the `$ROOCH` tokens will be used to incentivize LP providers, and holding `$LPXP` can earn `$ROOCH` airdrops in the future.
