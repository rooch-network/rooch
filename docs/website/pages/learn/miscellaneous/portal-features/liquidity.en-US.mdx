# Liquidity using guide

## Introduction

LP (Liquidity Provider) refers to token holders who combine two different tokens (such as `RGas` and `GROW`) into a token pair and stake it in Rooch’s liquidity pool (Farm). These pools receive liquidity from `RGas` and `GROW`, and liquidity providers are rewarded based on their contribution to the pool (in the form of `$LPXP`). Users holding `$LPXP` will have the opportunity to receive `$ROOCH` airdrops in the future.

Rooch now launches staking for `RGas` and `GROW` token pairs, and follows up with a simple demo to show the staking process.

## Staking process

Enter the Portal page, select `Liquidity` and click on the `Add` button on the right:

Just fill in the `RGas` and the LP pair will automatically calculate the `GROW` dosage:

The amount is calculated based on the official Swap pool, and the calculation formula is:

```
amount-in: The number of tokens
reserve-in: The token reserve
reserve-out: Output token reserve
fee-rate: Processing rate

amount-in-with-fee = amount-in * fee-rate
amount-out = (amount-in-with-fee * reserve-out) / (reserve-in * 10000 + amount-in-with-fee)

amount-in = (reserve-in * amount-out * 10000) / (reserve-out - amount-out * fee-rate) + 1
```

For detailed explanation, please refer to the code comments:

```move
// Calculate how many output tokens a user can obtain
public fun get_amount_out(
    amount_in: u64,
    reserve_in: u64,
    reserve_out: u64,
    fee_rate: u64,
): u64 {
    assert!(amount_in > 0, ErrorInputTokenAmount); // Make sure the input amount is greater than 0
    assert!(reserve_in > 0 && reserve_out > 0, ErrorInsufficientLiquidity); // Ensure that the pool is fluid enough

    let amount_in_with_fee = (amount_in as u128) * (fee_rate as u128); // Calculate the gas fee
    // Based on the constant product formula: (x + Δx)(y - Δy) = xy Calculate the output amount
    let numerator = amount_in_with_fee * (reserve_out as u128);
    let denominator = (reserve_in as u128) * 10000u128 + amount_in_with_fee;
    ((numerator / denominator) as u64)
}

// Calculate how many input tokens are required to obtain a specific number of output tokens
public fun get_amount_in(
    amount_out: u64,
    reserve_in: u64,
    reserve_out: u64,
    fee_rate: u64
): u64 {
    assert!(amount_out > 0, ErrorOutputTokenAmount);
    assert!(reserve_in > 0 && reserve_out > 0, ErrorInsufficientLiquidity);

    // Calculate in reverse from the constant product formula, add 1 to ensure that there is enough input
    let numerator = (reserve_in as u128) * (amount_out as u128) * 10000u128;
    let denominator = ((reserve_out as u128) - (amount_out as u128)) * (fee_rate as u128);
    (((numerator / denominator) as u64) + 1u64)
}
```

Check the estimated income of the LP group, click the `Confirm` button to complete the LP staking:

You can see the LP situation of the group just now:

Click the `Remove` button on the right to unstaking:

The calculation formula for group LP pairs:

```
point = x / x pool * 100%
y = y pool * point
```

## Earn token pairs

After forming an LP, you can stake the LP to Farm to obtain the income of the token pair. If you simply form a token pair, there will be no income.

Click the `Stake LP` button to stake token pairs:

After staking an LP, you can obtain `$LPXP` income.

In the [Rooch Network Tokenomics](https://rooch.network/blog/rooch-network-tokenomics) article released by Rooch, `5%` of the `$ROOCH` tokens will be used to incentivize LP providers, and holding `$LPXP` can earn `$ROOCH` airdrops in the future.
