# Liquidity using guide

## Introduction

LP tokens can be used to earn compound interest in liquidity mining, take out cryptocurrency loans, or transfer ownership of staking liquidity.

Rooch now launches staking for `RGas` and `GROW` token pairs, and follows up with a simple demo to show the staking process.

## Earn token pairs

After forming an LP, you can stake the LP to Farm to obtain the income of the token pair. If you simply form a token pair, there will be no income.
