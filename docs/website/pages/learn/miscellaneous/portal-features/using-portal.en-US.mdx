## Create session key

Session Key is a feature provided by Rooch, which provides a convenient experience for the interaction of blockchain applications. Using Portal also requires generating a Session Key.

Please click the `Create Session Key` button in the lower left corner. After the wallet is signed, a time-limited Session Key will be generated. You need to ensure that the account has `RGAS`.

## Component introduction
