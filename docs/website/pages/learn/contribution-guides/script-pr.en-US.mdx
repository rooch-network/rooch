# pr.sh script introduction

When contributing code to Rooch, we need to do some checking.

In order to avoid introducing some bugs every time we submit the code, we provide the `scripts/pr.sh` script, which can help us perform CI checks locally when submitting a PR (pull request) to Rooch.

## Using

Switch to the root directory of the Rooch project and run the following command:

```shell
./scripts/pr.sh -e
```

During the process of running the CI check, if a corresponding error occurs, it will be automatically interrupted. Make corresponding modifications to the code to be submitted based on the modification suggestions provided at the check point, and run again.

Until all checks pass, submit your code to Rooch's remote repository.
