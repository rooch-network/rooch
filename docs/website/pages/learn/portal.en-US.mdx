### Receive Gas

Rooch Portal requires the use of Gas when interacting with Rooch. Currently, we can receive `Rooch Gas Coin` through the Faucet channel of Rooch Discord.

> When using Portal for the first time, you need to send a transaction to generate a session key, otherwise Portal cannot be used normally.

Rooch’s Discord address: https://discord.gg/rooch

Enter `/faucet` in the input box and the command to receive `Rooch Gas Coin` will be displayed:

The address needs to be a Taproot type Bitcoin address, for example:

```command
/faucet tb1p8e5wrjksara963wm27lppr9z8wcfsj2htzdjgutp3rsx2lt0gd4smrdnn5
```

When the Faucet robot displays the following information, it means that you have successfully received the `Rooch Gas Coin`.
