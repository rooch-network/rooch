Rooch (/ruʧ/) is named by combining Root and Branch symbolizing the inspiration we get from how roots and branches are grown out of a seed and seeds can be spread out to grow a forest ecosystem, where, we believe Bitcoin is the seed we need, and building for the Bitcoin ecosystem is the path towards Web3 vision.

In this doc you will learn about how Rooch is designed to be a verifiable application contrainer and serve as the application layer for Bitcoin. If you are interested please also go through our Blog posts for more technical discussions.
