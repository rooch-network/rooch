Move is an open-source smart contract programming language originally designed and developed by Diem.

The name `Move` came from the [Move Semantics in C++](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3106110/what-is-move-semantics), where it is used to move resources from one object to another without copying. This design purpose fits right in the context of a smart contract lanague, and makes it a perfect choice to achieve the flexibility and safety of crypto assets.
