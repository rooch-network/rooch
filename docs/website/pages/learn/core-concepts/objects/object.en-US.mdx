# Rooch Object

import { Callout, FileTree } from 'nextra/components'

The Object in Rooch implements a Box (boxing) pattern. Creating an Object is like creating a box in the Object Storage space. You can encapsulate an instance of type `T` in this box, and the `ObjectID` is the address of this box.

## Ownership of Object

The `owner` field of `ObjectEntity` signifies which account address owns the Object. Through `owner`, Objects can be categorized into:

1. `SystemOwnedObject`: Objects with `owner` as `0x0`. After the creation of the object, it is defaulted to `SystemOwnedObject`.
2. `UserOwnedObject`: Objects with `owner` non-equal to `0x0`. Once the Object is transferred to a user, `owner` will be set as the address of that user.

## Object Life Cycle

### Creating an Object

An Object of type `T` can be created by invoking `object::new` method.

```move
module moveos_std::object {
    #[private_generics(T)]
    public fun new<T: key>(value: T): Object<T>;
}
```

* This method is protected by `private_generics(T)`, hence, it can only be invoked by the module where `T` is located. The developer of  `T` module gets to decide whether to provide the methods to encapsulate `T` into the `Object`.
* `T` must has the `key` ability.
* The ObjectID of this Object is a globally unique ID automatically assigned by the system.

In addition to the above normal Objects, two special Object creation methods are provided that do not automatically assign IDs; instead, they generate IDs through a predetermined algorithm, called Named Object.

```move
module moveos_std::object {
    #[private_generics(T)]
    public fun new_named_object<T: key>(value: T): Object<T>;

    #[private_generics(T)]
    public fun new_account_named_object<T: key>(account: address, value: T): Object<T>;
}
```

* NamedObject: ObjectID is generated using type name of `T`. The generation formula is `sha3(type_name<T>())`. This is generally used for globally unique Objects, like `0x3::timestamp::Timestamp`.
* Account NamedObject: ObjectID is generated using both the account address and type name of `T`. The generating formula is `sha3(account + type_name<T>())`. It's generally used for Objects of which each user owns only one, like `0x3::coin_store::CoinStore<CoinType>`.

### Operating an Object

#### Transferring Ownership

Transfer the Object to `new_owner`:

```move
module moveos_std::object {
    public fun transfer<T: key + store>(self: Object<T>, new_owner: address);
}
```

The `owner` retrieves their Object through `object_id`:

```move
module moveos_std::object {
    public fun take_object<T: key + store>(owner: &signer, object_id: ObjectID): Object<T>;
}
```

> Note: Once the Object is retrieved, the `owner` is set to `0x0`, at which point the Object becomes a `SystemOwnedObject`.

For the above methods, `T` must has `key + store` ability. Such types of Object are called `PublicObject`, and the user can transfer the ownership of `PublicObject` on their own.

If it is the type of Object that only has `key` ability, we can call it `PrivateObject`. Users cannot directly transfer the ownership of `PrivateObject`, and the ownership transfer of `PrivateObject` must be assisted by the API provided by the module where `T` is located.

```move
module moveos_std::object {
    #[private_generics(T)]
    public fun take_object_extend<T: key>(object_id: ObjectID): (address, Object<T>);
}
```

The `take_object_extend` method is protected by `private_generics(T)`, and can only be invoked by modules where `T` is located. The developer gets to decide whether to provide the method to transfer `PrivateObject` to other users.

#### Object Reference

`Object<T>` can be referenced in two ways, one is read-only reference `&Object<T>`, the other one is mutable reference `&mut Object<T>`.

We can get `&T` through `object::borrow(&Object<T>)` method, and `&mut T` through `object::borrow_mut(&mut Object<T>)`. As for what operations can be performed after obtaining `&T` and `&mut<T>`, this is defined by `T`'s module.

There are two ways to get the Object reference:

1. Passed in through the `entry` method.

```move
entry fun my_entry(obj: &Object<MyStruct>, obj_mut: &mut Object<MyStruct>) {
    // do something 
}
```

2. Obtained through `borrow_object` and `borrow_mut_object` methods.

```move
module moveos_std::object {
    public fun borrow_object<T: key>(object_id: ObjectID): &Object<T>;

    public fun borrow_mut_object<T: key>(owner: &signer, object_id: ObjectID): &mut Object<T>;
}
```

* Note, all Objects in Rooch are open to read, everyone can get any `&Object<T>` through `ObjectID`.
* The owner of the Object can get `&mut Object<T>` reference through `context::borrow_mut_object`.

Method extension for developers:

```move
module moveos_std::object {
    #[private_generics(T)]
    public fun borrow_mut_object_extend<T: key>(object_id: ObjectID): &mut Object<T>;
}
```

* The module where `T` is located can get any `&mut Object<T>` reference through `ObjectID`, except for cases when that Object is frozen.

#### Shared and Frozen Object

`Object<T>` has two states, `shared` and `frozen`.

* `SharedObject`: Everyone can directly get the `&mut Object<T>` reference.
* `FrozenObject`: No one can get the `&mut Object<T>` reference, even the module where `T` is located.

Following method can shift `Object<T>` to `SharedObject`.

```move
module moveos_std::object {
    public fun to_shared<T: key>(self: Object<T>);
}
```

To get the mutable reference of SharedObject, it must be passed through `entry` parameters or obtained via the method provided by `object`:

```move
module moveos_std::object {
    public fun borrow_mut_object_shared<T: key>(object_id: ObjectID): &mut Object<T>;
}
```

Following method can shift `Object<T>` to `FrozenObject`.

```move
module moveos_std::object {
    public fun to_frozen<T: key>(self: Object<T>);
}
```

> Note: Once Object becomes `frozen` or `shared`, it automatically become `SystemOwnedObject`; no one can directly get the instance of `Object<T>`, only the operations on the Object are feasible through the reference.

#### Nested Object

Given `Object<T>` itself has `store` ability, it can be nested in other structures as fields or be saved in containers like `vector`, `Table`, etc.

```move
struct Avatar has key {
    head: Object<Head>,
    body: Object<Body>,
}
```

In the above example, `Object<Head>` and `Object<Body>` are fields of the `Avatar` structure. These two objects belong to the `Avatar` structure. If the `Object<Avatar>` is transferred to other user, then the `Object<Head>` and `Object<Body>` will be transferred to the other user with the `Object<Avatar>`.

* Even in a nested state, Objects will still exist in Object Storage and can be accessed through the reference retrieval method described earlier.
* Nested Objects will always be `SystemOwnedObject`.

#### Deleting an Object

The following method can be used to delete Object:

```move
module moveos_std::object {
    #[private_generics(T)]
    public fun remove<T: key>(self: Object<T>): T;
}
```

Deleting an Object will return the encapsulated data in the Object, this method can only be called by the module where `T` is located.

### Object RPC

`ObjectEntity` data can be retrieved through `rooch_getState` RPC interface.

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST \
--data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"rooch_getStates","params":["/object/0x3::timestamp::Timestamp", {"decode":true}],"id":1}' \
https://dev-seed.rooch.network
```

In the above functions, if the `#[private_generics<T>]` column is `true`, it indicates that only the module where `T` is located can call the function.

### Comparison between Rooch Object, Sui Object, and Aptos Object

#### Sui Object

* Sui Object is a special kind of `struct` that requires the `struct` to has a `key` ability, and UID must be its first field. An Object is provided by the VM and storage, and there's no Object type in Move. In Rooch, Object is a type defined in Move itself.
* Sui Object is indexed by the external system, and there's no method provided in the contract to retrieve the Object using ID; it can only be passed through parameters. Rooch provides both methods.
* If a Sui Object gets nested or saved into other containers, it will become invisible in the global Object Storage. However, even when nested or saved into other containers, the Rooch Object can still be accessed in the global Object Storage.

#### Aptos Object

* At the base level, an Aptos Object is a special account, where the `address` is the `ObjectID`.
* `Object<T>` represents the reference to an Object that can be `copy`,`drop`, whereas in Rooch, `Object<T>` is a single instance and cannot be `copy`, `drop`.
* Aptos Object uses `DeleteRef`, `ExtendRef`, `TransferRef` to indicate different operation permissions on Object. But Rooch Object differentiates different permissions using read-only reference, mutable reference, and instance.
